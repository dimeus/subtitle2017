1
00:03:38,122 --> 00:03:39,692
Almost.

2
00:03:39,762 --> 00:03:41,605
"Almost."

3
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:45,532
Sir, with all due respect,
are you sure this is our best option?

4
00:03:45,602 --> 00:03:46,658
I mean, why can't we just correct

5
00:03:46,682 --> 00:03:49,652
- the problem?
- Because my fuckin' nephew...

6
00:03:50,922 --> 00:03:52,412
killed a dog.

7
00:03:54,122 --> 00:03:55,487
And he stole a car.

8
00:03:56,762 --> 00:03:58,173
A car...

9
00:03:59,322 --> 00:04:02,292
which currently is among our inventory.

10
00:04:06,522 --> 00:04:09,332
So we're giving everything up for a car?

11
00:04:11,242 --> 00:04:12,687
It's not just a car.

12
00:04:13,682 --> 00:04:16,003
It is John Wick's car.

13
00:04:17,682 --> 00:04:19,093
Oh.

14
00:04:25,202 --> 00:04:28,206
Sir, why don't we just give it back?

15
00:04:29,402 --> 00:04:31,325
He killed my nephew.

16
00:04:33,122 --> 00:04:34,203
My brother.

17
00:04:36,202 --> 00:04:38,091
And a dozen of my men.

18
00:04:40,402 --> 00:04:42,325
Over his car.

19
00:04:43,602 --> 00:04:44,967
And a puppy.

20
00:04:48,122 --> 00:04:51,843
And you...
you think he will stop now?

21
00:04:51,922 --> 00:04:53,208
Hmm?

22
00:04:56,162 --> 00:04:58,005
Sir, he's one man.

23
00:04:59,002 --> 00:05:00,572
Why don't we just eliminate him?

24
00:05:05,042 --> 00:05:06,487
John Wick...

25
00:05:06,562 --> 00:05:09,008
is a man of focus...

26
00:05:13,202 --> 00:05:14,488
Commitment...

27
00:05:21,482 --> 00:05:24,326
And sheer fuckin' will.

28
00:05:40,682 --> 00:05:42,411
He once killed three men in a bar...

29
00:05:42,482 --> 00:05:44,883
With a pencil. I know.
I've heard the story.

30
00:05:44,962 --> 00:05:46,532
With a fucking pencil!

31
00:05:47,762 --> 00:05:49,446
Who the fuck can do that?

32
00:05:51,922 --> 00:05:53,447
Well, I can assure you

33
00:05:55,242 --> 00:05:58,291
that the stories you hear about this man,

34
00:05:59,282 --> 00:06:05,369
if nothing else, has been watered down.

36
00:13:17,842 --> 00:13:19,082
...Mr. Wick.

37
00:15:48,442 --> 00:15:49,648
Hey, buddy.

38
00:15:56,882 --> 00:15:59,123
Hey.

39
00:16:05,962 --> 00:16:07,202
Good dog.

40
00:16:22,762 --> 00:16:25,129
- What are you doing, John?
- Looking at you.

41
00:16:26,122 --> 00:16:27,362
What are you doing?

42
00:16:27,442 --> 00:16:28,853
I'm waiting for you.

43
00:16:29,882 --> 00:16:31,043
Come here.

44
00:16:46,682 --> 00:16:47,843
Hey, boy.

45
00:17:13,322 --> 00:17:15,006
Nice peaceful place you got here.

46
00:17:16,402 --> 00:17:18,131
- Hey, Aurelio.
- Hey.

47
00:17:22,642 --> 00:17:25,964
John, what the hell?
I thought you loved this oar.

48
00:17:26,962 --> 00:17:28,248
What do you think?

49
00:17:28,322 --> 00:17:30,802
Well, your motor's
about to fall out and...

50
00:17:31,802 --> 00:17:32,928
the chassis' all bent up,

51
00:17:34,002 --> 00:17:36,004
the... the driveshaft is all destroyed.

52
00:17:36,082 --> 00:17:38,922
And I don't know if you noticed,
but you got a crack in your windshield.

53
00:17:39,882 --> 00:17:42,249
I mean... what do I think?

54
00:17:43,762 --> 00:17:45,173
I could fix this.

55
00:17:46,762 --> 00:17:48,127
Thanks for finding her.

56
00:17:48,202 --> 00:17:51,331
Not a problem, man.
I just made a few calls. No big deal.

57
00:17:54,202 --> 00:17:55,647
Let me know when it's fixed.

58
00:17:56,802 --> 00:18:00,284
All right. It'll be ready Christmas...

59
00:18:00,362 --> 00:18:01,727
2030.

60
00:19:40,842 --> 00:19:41,843
Ciao, John.

61
00:19:43,562 --> 00:19:44,563
Santino.

62
00:20:03,562 --> 00:20:04,688
Café?

63
00:20:05,682 --> 00:20:06,922
Grazie.

64
00:20:11,242 --> 00:20:12,289
Good to see you.

65
00:20:13,282 --> 00:20:14,613
Good to see you.

66
00:20:34,682 --> 00:20:37,003
I was sorry to hear about your wife, John.

67
00:20:39,282 --> 00:20:40,613
Thank you.

68
00:20:42,562 --> 00:20:43,563
Hi.

69
00:20:46,682 --> 00:20:49,253
And the dog,
does he have a name?

70
00:20:50,442 --> 00:20:51,523
No.

71
00:21:00,722 --> 00:21:04,443
Listen, John... with all sincerity...

72
00:21:06,522 --> 00:21:07,853
I don't want to be here.

73
00:21:07,922 --> 00:21:09,606
Please, don't.

74
00:21:10,602 --> 00:21:12,525
I'm asking you not to do this.

75
00:21:13,522 --> 00:21:14,683
I'm sorry.

76
00:21:19,402 --> 00:21:25,364
No one gets out and comes back
without repercussions.

77
00:21:27,402 --> 00:21:30,053
I do this with a heavy heart, John.

78
00:21:33,522 --> 00:21:37,129
But remember, if not for what I did

79
00:21:37,202 --> 00:21:40,285
on the night of your impossible task,

80
00:21:40,402 --> 00:21:44,373
you wouldn't be here right now, like this.

81
00:21:44,442 --> 00:21:47,366
This is because of me.

82
00:21:47,442 --> 00:21:48,967
This, in part, is mine.

83
00:21:49,962 --> 00:21:52,124
Take it back.

84
00:21:52,202 --> 00:21:53,482
- "Take it back"?
- Take it back.

85
00:21:54,322 --> 00:21:57,166
A marker is no small thing, John.

86
00:21:58,242 --> 00:22:00,563
For a man to grant a marker to another,

87
00:22:01,642 --> 00:22:04,168
is to bind a soul to a blood oath.

88
00:22:08,282 --> 00:22:10,171
Find someone else.

89
00:22:13,922 --> 00:22:15,367
Listen to me.

90
00:22:15,442 --> 00:22:16,853
What is this? Hmm?

91
00:22:17,842 --> 00:22:20,322
Do you remember? This is your blood.

92
00:22:21,522 --> 00:22:24,366
You came to me. I helped you.

93
00:22:25,562 --> 00:22:28,213
If you don't do this,

94
00:22:28,282 --> 00:22:30,569
you know the consequences.

95
00:22:32,682 --> 00:22:34,650
I'm not that guy anymore.

96
00:22:39,082 --> 00:22:41,130
You are always that guy, John.

97
00:22:45,842 --> 00:22:47,287
I can't help you.

98
00:22:59,522 --> 00:23:00,933
I'm sorry.

99
00:23:14,122 --> 00:23:16,602
Yes. You're right.

100
00:23:17,682 --> 00:23:18,763
You can't.

101
00:23:22,322 --> 00:23:24,211
But he can.

102
00:23:24,282 --> 00:23:25,932
I'll see you soon, John.

103
00:23:38,042 --> 00:23:40,568
You have a beautiful home, John.

104
00:23:42,842 --> 00:23:44,128
Buenasera.

105
00:25:57,562 --> 00:25:59,530
Well, good evenin', John.

106
00:26:00,522 --> 00:26:01,808
Hey, Jimmy.

107
00:26:04,162 --> 00:26:05,493
Gas leak?

108
00:26:07,522 --> 00:26:09,092
Yeah, gas leak.

109
00:26:10,762 --> 00:26:12,332
You workin' again?

110
00:26:15,202 --> 00:26:16,647
I'll see you, Jimmy.

111
00:26:17,842 --> 00:26:19,731
Come on, boy.

112
00:26:23,002 --> 00:26:24,527
'Night, John.

113
00:26:26,802 --> 00:26:28,247
Oh, shit.

114
00:27:11,882 --> 00:27:13,805
I'd like to see the manager.

115
00:27:13,882 --> 00:27:16,613
How good to see you again so soon,
Mr. Wick.

116
00:27:17,682 --> 00:27:18,888
Shall I announce you?

117
00:27:19,882 --> 00:27:21,247
Yes, please.

118
00:27:22,362 --> 00:27:23,727
Stay.

119
00:27:31,562 --> 00:27:34,088
Mr. Wick is on his way to see you, sir.

120
00:27:47,402 --> 00:27:48,642
Impeccable.

121
00:27:50,522 --> 00:27:53,810
Put these into circulation.

122
00:28:07,642 --> 00:28:08,848
Where is he?

123
00:28:10,722 --> 00:28:12,611
Thank you, my friend.

124
00:28:12,682 --> 00:28:14,764
Beautiful work. Beautiful.

125
00:28:22,042 --> 00:28:23,692
What are you doing, Jonathan?

126
00:28:25,082 --> 00:28:27,289
He burned my house down.

127
00:28:27,362 --> 00:28:30,571
You rejected his marker.
You're lucky he stopped there.

128
00:28:31,962 --> 00:28:33,098
What the hell were you thinking,

129
00:28:33,122 --> 00:28:36,205
giving a marker to a man
like Santino D'Antonio?

130
00:28:36,282 --> 00:28:38,853
It was the only way I could get out.

131
00:28:38,922 --> 00:28:41,846
Oh. You call this "out"?

132
00:28:43,682 --> 00:28:45,969
What did you think was gonna happen?
Huh?

133
00:28:46,042 --> 00:28:47,851
What did you expect? Huh?

134
00:28:47,922 --> 00:28:51,563
Did you really think this day
was never going to come'? Hmm?

135
00:28:54,042 --> 00:28:55,692
What does he want you to do?

136
00:28:57,842 --> 00:28:59,173
I didn't ask.

137
00:29:00,162 --> 00:29:01,368
I just said no.

138
00:29:04,482 --> 00:29:07,088
Two rules that cannot be broken, Jonathan.

139
00:29:08,082 --> 00:29:12,087
No blood on Continental grounds,
and every marker must be honored.

140
00:29:13,322 --> 00:29:16,849
Now while my judgment comes
in the form of excommunicado,

141
00:29:17,842 --> 00:29:19,731
the High Table

142
00:29:19,802 --> 00:29:22,965
demand a more severe outcome
if their traditions are refused.

143
00:29:24,522 --> 00:29:26,206
I have no choice?

144
00:29:27,522 --> 00:29:29,445
You dishonor the marker, you die.

145
00:29:29,522 --> 00:29:31,650
You kill the holder of the marker,
you die.

146
00:29:31,722 --> 00:29:33,884
You run, you die.

147
00:29:35,402 --> 00:29:37,530
This is what you agreed to, Jonathan.

148
00:29:38,522 --> 00:29:40,206
Do what the man asks.

149
00:29:41,522 --> 00:29:42,808
Be free.

150
00:29:42,882 --> 00:29:48,048
Then, if you want to go after him,
burn his house down, be my guest.

151
00:29:48,122 --> 00:29:49,453
But until then...

152
00:29:52,202 --> 00:29:53,363
Rules.

153
00:29:54,362 --> 00:29:57,366
Exactly. Rules.

154
00:29:57,482 --> 00:29:59,723
Without them, we'd live with the animals.

155
00:30:08,242 --> 00:30:09,607
Do you board?

156
00:30:10,882 --> 00:30:13,931
I'm sorry to say, sir,
but this facility does not.

157
00:30:15,602 --> 00:30:21,371
I, however, would be willing to accept
the responsibility, should you wish.

158
00:30:23,002 --> 00:30:24,413
Appreciate that.

159
00:30:24,482 --> 00:30:26,211
Does he have a name, sir?

160
00:30:26,282 --> 00:30:27,283
No.

161
00:30:27,362 --> 00:30:29,524
Good dog.

162
00:30:29,642 --> 00:30:31,326
Stay.

163
00:31:34,562 --> 00:31:37,406
This was my father's collection.

164
00:31:38,682 --> 00:31:42,209
I see little more
than just paint on canvas, of course.

165
00:31:44,522 --> 00:31:46,490
But I do find myself here.

166
00:31:48,362 --> 00:31:49,727
Please.

167
00:32:02,722 --> 00:32:04,053
I didn't want to do this, John.

168
00:32:05,042 --> 00:32:08,569
Had you stayed retired,
I would have respected it.

169
00:32:10,682 --> 00:32:11,763
Look at you.

170
00:32:12,922 --> 00:32:15,129
You're thinkin' about it, aren't you?

171
00:32:16,402 --> 00:32:19,884
You're counting exits... guards...

172
00:32:21,722 --> 00:32:23,565
Could you get to me in time?

173
00:32:25,882 --> 00:32:27,691
How would you do it, I wonder?

174
00:32:29,922 --> 00:32:30,923
That woman's pen?

175
00:32:33,442 --> 00:32:34,443
His cane?

176
00:32:36,722 --> 00:32:37,928
Maybe his glasses?

177
00:32:39,042 --> 00:32:40,612
My hands.

178
00:32:41,722 --> 00:32:45,010
Ah. How exciting.

179
00:32:46,002 --> 00:32:47,731
Yet you know you cannot, can you?

180
00:32:49,042 --> 00:32:52,808
I told you I needed that guy,

181
00:32:52,882 --> 00:32:55,203
the way you are looking at me right now.

182
00:32:56,322 --> 00:32:58,802
I needed the Boogeyman.

183
00:32:58,882 --> 00:33:00,372
I needed John Wick.

184
00:33:00,442 --> 00:33:03,366
Just... tell me what you want.

185
00:33:08,722 --> 00:33:11,248
I want you to kill my sister.

186
00:33:13,242 --> 00:33:14,607
Why?

187
00:33:14,722 --> 00:33:18,010
There are 12 seats at the High Table.

188
00:33:19,602 --> 00:33:22,253
Camorra, Mafia, and 'Ndrangheta.

189
00:33:24,162 --> 00:33:26,164
The Chinese, the Russian.

190
00:33:27,482 --> 00:33:29,530
When my father died...

191
00:33:31,122 --> 00:33:33,250
he willed his seat to her.

192
00:33:34,922 --> 00:33:37,846
She represents Camorra now.

193
00:33:37,922 --> 00:33:40,289
And I can't help but wonder...

194
00:33:41,682 --> 00:33:44,208
what I might accomplish in her stead.

195
00:33:46,042 --> 00:33:51,526
You want me to kill... Gianna D'Antonio?

196
00:33:54,242 --> 00:33:55,448
I could never do it.

197
00:33:56,442 --> 00:33:58,126
She is my blood.

198
00:33:58,202 --> 00:33:59,283
I still love her.

199
00:34:00,282 --> 00:34:01,852
It can't be done.

200
00:34:01,922 --> 00:34:05,483
She's in Rome for her coronation.

201
00:34:06,482 --> 00:34:11,010
- You will take the catacombs in...
- It doesn't matter where she is.

202
00:34:11,082 --> 00:34:16,248
That's why I need the ghost,
lo spettro, John Wick.

203
00:34:17,242 --> 00:34:19,051
That's why I need you.

204
00:34:20,162 --> 00:34:21,402
Do this for me,

205
00:34:22,402 --> 00:34:24,325
and your marker is honored.

206
00:34:25,682 --> 00:34:27,332
What say you?

207
00:34:35,122 --> 00:34:36,965
Never one to waste words.

208
00:34:53,522 --> 00:34:56,002
Fifty-nine, zero, 3.5.

209
00:36:59,162 --> 00:37:00,573
Jonathan!

210
00:37:01,962 --> 00:37:03,327
Julius.

211
00:37:05,402 --> 00:37:07,291
- Ciao.
- Nice to see you.

212
00:37:13,082 --> 00:37:16,291
I fail to recall the last time
you were in Rome.

213
00:37:17,602 --> 00:37:18,842
And here I'd heard

214
00:37:19,842 --> 00:37:21,082
you had retired.

215
00:37:22,642 --> 00:37:23,848
I had.

216
00:37:25,082 --> 00:37:28,609
Then humor me with, uh...
but one question.

217
00:37:38,682 --> 00:37:39,843
No.

218
00:37:42,282 --> 00:37:43,488
All right, then.

219
00:37:49,002 --> 00:37:52,051
One of our finest rooms.

220
00:37:56,682 --> 00:37:57,808
Grazie.

221
00:37:59,082 --> 00:38:00,572
Enjoy your stay.

222
00:38:08,082 --> 00:38:09,083
Mr. Wick.

223
00:38:28,562 --> 00:38:30,132
Is the sommelier in?

224
00:38:30,202 --> 00:38:32,091
I have never known him not to be.

225
00:38:48,162 --> 00:38:49,812
Good afternoon, Mr. Wick.

226
00:38:51,402 --> 00:38:52,688
It's been a long time.

227
00:38:52,762 --> 00:38:54,332
I'd like a tasting.

228
00:38:54,402 --> 00:38:57,406
I am quite excited
to show you something.

229
00:38:58,842 --> 00:38:59,843
First...

230
00:39:05,962 --> 00:39:08,249
Buongiorno, Signor Wick.

231
00:39:08,322 --> 00:39:09,323
Ciao, Angelo.

232
00:39:09,402 --> 00:39:10,847
Welcome back to Rome.

233
00:39:13,762 --> 00:39:14,763
I am.

234
00:39:14,842 --> 00:39:17,925
I know of your past fondness
for the German varietals,

235
00:39:18,042 --> 00:39:22,206
but I can wholeheartedly endorse
the new breed of Austrians.

236
00:39:23,202 --> 00:39:25,933
Glock .34 and .26.

237
00:39:27,002 --> 00:39:29,733
This is the original map
of the D'Antonio estate.

238
00:39:29,802 --> 00:39:32,282
Here, you have all the ancient ruins.

239
00:39:34,922 --> 00:39:38,813
Tell me, Mr. Wick,
is this a formal event or a social affair?

240
00:39:38,882 --> 00:39:42,773
- Social.
- And is this for day or evening?

241
00:39:42,842 --> 00:39:45,083
I need one for day and one for night.

242
00:39:45,162 --> 00:39:46,402
Recontoured grips.

243
00:39:47,402 --> 00:39:50,485
Flared magwell for easier reloads.

244
00:39:50,562 --> 00:39:52,963
And I know you'll appreciate
the custom porting.

245
00:39:55,922 --> 00:39:57,447
What's next?

246
00:39:57,522 --> 00:40:01,163
I need something robust. Precise.

247
00:40:01,242 --> 00:40:04,086
"Robust. Precise."

248
00:40:05,362 --> 00:40:10,766
This is the map of the temple
and catacombs underneath.

249
00:40:10,842 --> 00:40:12,571
- In what style?
- Italian.

250
00:40:12,682 --> 00:40:14,252
- How many buttons?
- Two.

251
00:40:14,322 --> 00:40:16,006
- Trousers?
- Tapered.

252
00:40:16,082 --> 00:40:17,288
How about the lining?

253
00:40:17,362 --> 00:40:18,966
Tactical.

254
00:40:20,282 --> 00:40:24,128
AR-15, 11.5-inch.

255
00:40:24,202 --> 00:40:27,126
Compensated
with an ion-bonded bolt carrier.

256
00:40:27,202 --> 00:40:30,172
Trijicon accupoint
with one-six magnification.

257
00:40:30,282 --> 00:40:34,367
And this is the modern blueprint.

258
00:40:34,442 --> 00:40:37,764
There are one, two, three gates.

259
00:40:40,362 --> 00:40:43,332
Silicon carbide discs.
Ceramic matrices.

260
00:40:43,402 --> 00:40:45,052
Accompanying laminates.

261
00:40:45,122 --> 00:40:46,886
Cutting-edge body armor.

262
00:40:46,962 --> 00:40:50,648
We just sew it between the fabric
and the lining.

263
00:40:50,762 --> 00:40:53,413
Zero penetration. However...

264
00:40:54,762 --> 00:40:56,207
quite painful, I'm afraid.

265
00:40:56,282 --> 00:40:59,650
Could you recommend anything
for the end of the night?

266
00:40:59,722 --> 00:41:01,850
Something big, bold.

267
00:41:01,922 --> 00:41:05,324
May I suggest the Benelli M4?

268
00:41:09,882 --> 00:41:11,930
Custom bolt carrier release
and charging handle.

269
00:41:12,922 --> 00:41:16,210
Textured grips,
should your hands get... wet.

270
00:41:19,242 --> 00:41:21,165
An Italian classic.

271
00:41:21,242 --> 00:41:22,289
Dessert?

272
00:41:22,362 --> 00:41:24,490
Dessert.

273
00:41:25,482 --> 00:41:29,282
The finest cutlery. All freshly stoned.

274
00:41:38,882 --> 00:41:40,293
Well done.

275
00:41:40,362 --> 00:41:42,364
- Could you do a rush order?
- I sure can.

276
00:41:42,442 --> 00:41:44,251
Where would you like to have it sent?

277
00:41:44,322 --> 00:41:45,369
The hotel.

278
00:41:45,482 --> 00:41:47,162
Shall I have everything sent to your room?

279
00:41:48,082 --> 00:41:50,369
- Yes. Thank you.
- Excellent.

280
00:41:51,962 --> 00:41:53,168
Mr. Wick?

281
00:41:56,802 --> 00:41:58,691
Do enjoy your party.

282
00:45:53,282 --> 00:45:54,283
Good evening.

283
00:45:55,402 --> 00:45:57,166
Are you enjoying the party?

284
00:46:45,522 --> 00:46:47,012
Mr. Akoni.

285
00:46:52,402 --> 00:46:54,404
Are you enjoying the festivities?

286
00:46:57,562 --> 00:47:00,452
Please. Sit.

287
00:47:04,842 --> 00:47:06,571
Ms. D'Antonio,

288
00:47:06,642 --> 00:47:08,849
you can't just take
what is rightfully mine...

289
00:47:08,922 --> 00:47:10,128
Nothing was taken.

290
00:47:11,282 --> 00:47:14,729
Those among your own
came to us with these territories.

291
00:47:14,802 --> 00:47:16,372
A knife was pressed to their throats.

292
00:47:17,362 --> 00:47:18,363
Semantics.

293
00:47:19,362 --> 00:47:20,443
Besides...

294
00:47:21,442 --> 00:47:24,764
That blade you speak of was meant
for their children.

295
00:47:26,082 --> 00:47:28,449
They were only meant to watch.

296
00:47:29,562 --> 00:47:33,248
What is yours is now ours, Mr. Akoni.

297
00:47:35,322 --> 00:47:36,483
Now go.

298
00:47:39,602 --> 00:47:41,013
Enjoy the party.

299
00:47:42,522 --> 00:47:44,047
Have some fun.

300
00:47:55,282 --> 00:47:56,807
S?, signora.

301
00:48:42,762 --> 00:48:44,002
John.

302
00:48:45,922 --> 00:48:47,083
Gianna.

303
00:48:53,362 --> 00:48:58,687
There was a time not so long ago
in which I considered us as friends.

304
00:49:02,402 --> 00:49:03,733
I still do.

305
00:49:07,482 --> 00:49:08,688
Yet here you are.

306
00:49:15,922 --> 00:49:18,004
What brought you back, John?

307
00:49:19,442 --> 00:49:20,853
A marker.

308
00:49:22,922 --> 00:49:24,003
Held by?

309
00:49:26,442 --> 00:49:27,887
Your brother.

310
00:49:35,802 --> 00:49:37,042
Tell me, John.

311
00:49:38,042 --> 00:49:39,567
This marker...

312
00:49:41,082 --> 00:49:42,607
Is it how you got out?

313
00:49:45,442 --> 00:49:46,523
And what was her name,

314
00:49:47,522 --> 00:49:50,173
this woman whose life has ended my own?

315
00:49:52,762 --> 00:49:54,048
Helen.

316
00:49:55,082 --> 00:49:56,243
"Helen."

317
00:49:59,402 --> 00:50:00,927
This Helen...

318
00:50:02,842 --> 00:50:05,925
was she worth the price
that you now seek to pay?

319
00:50:12,882 --> 00:50:14,293
Now...

320
00:50:16,842 --> 00:50:19,288
let me tell you what happens when I die.

321
00:50:20,282 --> 00:50:23,445
Santino will lay claim
to my seat at the Table.

322
00:50:24,802 --> 00:50:26,566
He will take New York.

323
00:50:28,602 --> 00:50:32,971
And you... will have been the one
who gifted it to him.

324
00:51:23,522 --> 00:51:25,843
What would your Helen
think about that, John?

325
00:51:45,162 --> 00:51:47,563
What would your Helen think about you?

326
00:51:48,562 --> 00:51:49,688
Hmm?

327
00:52:04,882 --> 00:52:06,168
Why?

328
00:52:11,562 --> 00:52:13,132
Because...

329
00:52:13,202 --> 00:52:16,445
I lived my life my way.

330
00:52:18,002 --> 00:52:20,164
And I'll die my way.

331
00:52:35,202 --> 00:52:37,967
Do you fear damnation, John?

332
00:52:40,002 --> 00:52:41,163
Yes.

333
00:52:47,962 --> 00:52:49,202
You know,

334
00:52:50,202 --> 00:52:53,729
I always thought I could escape it.

335
00:52:55,682 --> 00:52:57,730
That I'd see it coming.

336
00:53:01,322 --> 00:53:03,290
That I'd see you.

337
00:54:16,002 --> 00:54:17,163
John?

338
00:54:22,882 --> 00:54:24,213
Cassian.

339
00:54:26,682 --> 00:54:27,763
You working?

340
00:54:30,282 --> 00:54:32,091
Yeah.

341
00:54:32,162 --> 00:54:33,163
You?

342
00:54:34,602 --> 00:54:35,763
Yeah.

343
00:54:39,202 --> 00:54:40,363
Good night?

344
00:54:43,122 --> 00:54:44,453
Afraid so.

345
00:54:46,642 --> 00:54:48,212
I'm sorry to hear that.

346
00:57:50,202 --> 00:57:51,613
Loose ends?

347
00:57:59,162 --> 00:58:00,493
Yeah...

348
01:02:22,802 --> 01:02:24,602
You're not havin' a good night,
are you, John?

349
01:04:50,402 --> 01:04:51,403
Gentlemen!

350
01:04:53,922 --> 01:04:55,048
Gentlemen!

351
01:05:07,282 --> 01:05:09,046
Do I need to remind you

352
01:05:09,122 --> 01:05:10,772
that there will be no business

353
01:05:10,842 --> 01:05:13,413
conducted on the Continental grounds?

354
01:05:14,882 --> 01:05:15,929
No, signore.

355
01:05:17,162 --> 01:05:18,368
No, sir.

356
01:05:20,162 --> 01:05:21,163
Bene.

357
01:05:22,162 --> 01:05:27,612
Now, may I suggest a visit to the bar,

358
01:05:27,682 --> 01:05:29,172
so you can calm yourselves.

359
01:05:33,602 --> 01:05:35,172
Gin, wasn't it?

360
01:05:36,202 --> 01:05:37,363
Yes.

361
01:05:38,882 --> 01:05:41,726
Bourbon, right?

362
01:05:43,162 --> 01:05:44,243
Yeah.

363
01:06:10,882 --> 01:06:12,407
I had a marker.

364
01:06:14,442 --> 01:06:15,603
Whose?

365
01:06:16,722 --> 01:06:18,212
Her brother.

366
01:06:23,362 --> 01:06:24,523
I see.

367
01:06:26,242 --> 01:06:27,926
You had no choice.

368
01:06:32,642 --> 01:06:35,009
He wants her seat at the Table.

369
01:06:36,762 --> 01:06:38,412
He will get it now.

370
01:06:41,402 --> 01:06:44,608
Yeah.

371
01:06:47,922 --> 01:06:49,447
So you're free.

372
01:06:56,282 --> 01:06:57,443
Am I?

373
01:06:59,962 --> 01:07:01,009
No.

374
01:07:02,962 --> 01:07:04,373
Not at all.

375
01:07:06,762 --> 01:07:11,131
You killed my ward.
Someone I was close to.

376
01:07:13,442 --> 01:07:14,967
An eye for an eye, John.

377
01:07:16,522 --> 01:07:18,047
You know how it goes.

378
01:07:20,442 --> 01:07:21,489
Yeah.

379
01:07:27,842 --> 01:07:29,571
I'll make it quick.

380
01:07:30,722 --> 01:07:32,212
I promise.

381
01:07:34,162 --> 01:07:35,846
I appreciate that.

382
01:07:37,002 --> 01:07:39,084
I'll try and do the same.

383
01:07:48,722 --> 01:07:50,053
This round's on me.

384
01:07:53,162 --> 01:07:55,483
Consider it a professional courtesy.

385
01:08:29,522 --> 01:08:31,763
No. Thanks.

386
01:09:34,562 --> 01:09:36,564
Hello, John.

387
01:09:36,642 --> 01:09:38,929
I understand if you're upset.

388
01:09:39,002 --> 01:09:41,733
And I know it might feel personal.

389
01:09:41,802 --> 01:09:44,089
But what kind of man would I be

390
01:09:44,202 --> 01:09:46,603
if I didn't avenge my sister's murder?

391
01:09:47,842 --> 01:09:49,003
John?

392
01:10:05,762 --> 01:10:09,289
Could you let management know
I'll be checking out in the morning.

393
01:10:47,682 --> 01:10:50,333
Operator. How may I direct your call?

394
01:10:50,402 --> 01:10:52,689
- Accounts payable.
- One moment, please.

395
01:11:05,482 --> 01:11:06,538
Accounts payable.

396
01:11:06,562 --> 01:11:07,723
How may I help you?

397
01:11:07,802 --> 01:11:09,178
I'd like to open an account.

398
01:11:09,202 --> 01:11:11,603
- Name on the account?
- John Wick.

399
01:11:11,682 --> 01:11:13,332
Verification?

400
01:11:13,402 --> 01:11:15,245
9305-05.

401
01:11:17,042 --> 01:11:18,373
State of contract?

402
01:11:18,442 --> 01:11:21,252
- Open.
- Denomination?

403
01:11:23,002 --> 01:11:24,003
Seven million.

404
01:11:24,082 --> 01:11:26,210
Processing. Please hold.

405
01:11:29,282 --> 01:11:32,252
- I appreciate the service.
- My pleasure.

406
01:11:32,322 --> 01:11:34,563
You will find safe passage below.

407
01:11:38,562 --> 01:11:40,371
Transportation is waiting for you.

408
01:11:41,922 --> 01:11:46,610
May you have a safe journey, Mr. Wick.

409
01:13:17,882 --> 01:13:19,043
Order confirmed.

410
01:13:22,642 --> 01:13:25,168
- What is this?
- He completed the task.

411
01:13:26,162 --> 01:13:28,244
The marker is over.

412
01:13:29,242 --> 01:13:30,243
Mark it.

413
01:13:30,322 --> 01:13:34,088
If Mr. Wick isn't dead already,

414
01:13:34,162 --> 01:13:35,493
he soon will be.

415
01:13:38,002 --> 01:13:40,733
Will you mark it, sir?

416
01:13:54,202 --> 01:13:57,809
You have no idea what's coming, do you?

417
01:13:59,922 --> 01:14:03,165
I have everyone in New York
looking for him.

418
01:14:03,242 --> 01:14:05,563
I doubt we will see him again.

419
01:14:08,402 --> 01:14:09,767
Do you now?

420
01:14:11,682 --> 01:14:14,413
You stabbed the devil in the back

421
01:14:14,482 --> 01:14:17,725
and forced him back
into the life that he had just left.

422
01:14:19,722 --> 01:14:22,453
You incinerated the priest's temple.

423
01:14:22,562 --> 01:14:23,723
Burned it to the ground.

424
01:14:25,402 --> 01:14:28,770
Now he's free of the marker,
what do you think he'll do?

425
01:14:31,482 --> 01:14:34,053
He had a glimpse of the other side

426
01:14:34,122 --> 01:14:35,692
and he embraced it.

427
01:14:35,762 --> 01:14:37,651
But you, Signor D'Antonio...

428
01:14:38,922 --> 01:14:40,048
took it away from him.

429
01:14:41,082 --> 01:14:42,527
He was already back.

430
01:14:42,602 --> 01:14:45,208
Oh, he came back for love, not for you.

431
01:14:45,282 --> 01:14:47,762
He owed me. I had every right.

432
01:14:48,762 --> 01:14:51,766
And now he's coming again.

433
01:14:54,002 --> 01:14:55,413
He did tell you not to do this.

434
01:14:58,882 --> 01:15:00,088
He did warn you.

435
01:15:01,642 --> 01:15:03,132
Addio, Santino.

436
01:19:07,802 --> 01:19:11,852
Please notify MTA
personnel of any suspicious activity.

437
01:19:19,842 --> 01:19:21,731
Your attention, please.

438
01:19:21,802 --> 01:19:25,284
The Broad Street bound C train
is now arriving.

439
01:19:26,762 --> 01:19:28,207
Your attention, please.

440
01:19:28,282 --> 01:19:31,650
The Broad Street bound C train
is now arriving.

441
01:19:45,162 --> 01:19:47,369
Next stop, Canal Street.

442
01:20:07,882 --> 01:20:09,532
This is Canal Street.

443
01:20:11,842 --> 01:20:15,403
This is the Broad Street bound C train.

444
01:20:15,482 --> 01:20:17,803
Next stop is Rector Street.

445
01:20:42,962 --> 01:20:44,964
This is Rector Street.

446
01:20:49,962 --> 01:20:52,852
This is the Broad Street bound C train.

447
01:20:53,922 --> 01:20:56,209
The next stop is Broad Street.

448
01:22:19,362 --> 01:22:21,729
This is Broad Street.

449
01:22:21,802 --> 01:22:24,487
This is the last stop
on the southbound C train.

450
01:22:24,562 --> 01:22:26,769
The blade is in your aorta.

451
01:22:26,842 --> 01:22:29,049
You pull it out, you will bleed,
and you will die.

452
01:22:30,042 --> 01:22:32,242
This is the end of the line.

453
01:22:34,962 --> 01:22:37,329
Consider this a professional courtesy.

454
01:22:38,482 --> 01:22:40,325
This is Broad Street.

455
01:22:40,402 --> 01:22:43,531
This is the last stop
on the southbound C train.

456
01:22:45,522 --> 01:22:47,331
This is the end of the line.

457
01:23:22,842 --> 01:23:26,483
We see things,
we see things.

458
01:23:26,562 --> 01:23:29,850
The things you see are nightmares, man.

459
01:23:29,922 --> 01:23:32,004
Like this one time...

460
01:23:35,482 --> 01:23:36,847
Take me to him.

461
01:23:38,042 --> 01:23:42,013
Tell him it's John Wick.

462
01:23:58,082 --> 01:24:01,052
You know, they just...
they put it in everything!

463
01:24:01,122 --> 01:24:03,363
Hey, man. You got a quarter?

464
01:25:54,042 --> 01:25:56,010
As I live and breathe!

465
01:25:57,162 --> 01:25:58,652
John Wick.

466
01:25:59,642 --> 01:26:00,643
The man.

467
01:26:01,642 --> 01:26:03,167
The myth.

468
01:26:03,242 --> 01:26:05,688
The legend.

469
01:26:05,762 --> 01:26:09,050
You're not very good at retiring.

470
01:26:09,122 --> 01:26:10,806
I'm workin' on it.

471
01:26:11,962 --> 01:26:15,444
Mr. Wick doesn't remember,
but we met many years ago,

472
01:26:15,522 --> 01:26:17,331
before my ascension...

473
01:26:18,682 --> 01:26:21,253
When I was just a pawn in the game.

474
01:26:23,082 --> 01:26:25,813
We met and you gave me a gift,

475
01:26:25,882 --> 01:26:27,646
the gift that would make me a king.

476
01:26:30,282 --> 01:26:33,445
You don't remember, but there I was,
standing in an alleyway.

477
01:26:35,042 --> 01:26:36,692
I didn't even hear you comin'.

478
01:26:40,162 --> 01:26:42,529
You gave me this.

479
01:26:46,762 --> 01:26:48,412
Gift from the Boogeyman.

480
01:26:49,402 --> 01:26:51,928
Perfect for every occasion.

481
01:26:54,602 --> 01:26:56,809
But you also gave me a choice.

482
01:26:57,922 --> 01:27:01,768
Pull my gun,
shoot you in the back, and die,

483
01:27:01,842 --> 01:27:04,049
or keep the pressure on my neck...

484
01:27:05,682 --> 01:27:06,729
and live.

485
01:27:08,962 --> 01:27:10,566
And so you see, I survived.

486
01:27:12,002 --> 01:27:15,848
No one sneaks up on me anymore,
thanks to you.

487
01:27:17,042 --> 01:27:20,524
I am all-seeing and all-knowing.

488
01:27:22,482 --> 01:27:24,644
Then you know why I'm here.

489
01:27:25,962 --> 01:27:29,728
Santino D'Antonio, yes.

490
01:27:29,802 --> 01:27:32,408
Your contract went wide, John.

491
01:27:33,482 --> 01:27:35,371
That's bad for your health.

492
01:27:36,362 --> 01:27:38,205
What's the number up to now, Earl?

493
01:27:39,522 --> 01:27:41,729
Seven million dollars!

494
01:27:41,802 --> 01:27:42,803
Damn!

495
01:27:44,002 --> 01:27:47,006
It's Christmas.
We're going to Applebee's after this.

496
01:27:50,722 --> 01:27:52,929
I need your help.

497
01:27:53,002 --> 01:27:56,768
You have eyes begging for change
on every corner in the city.

498
01:27:56,842 --> 01:27:59,049
I'm thinkin' you can find Santino.

499
01:28:00,242 --> 01:28:03,132
I need you to move me. Underground.

500
01:28:03,202 --> 01:28:04,488
Get me to him.

501
01:28:05,482 --> 01:28:08,008
How sweet it is!

502
01:28:09,002 --> 01:28:11,573
The Boogeyman begging me for help.

503
01:28:11,682 --> 01:28:13,491
Well, of course, John.

504
01:28:13,602 --> 01:28:16,173
Yes, John. Whatever you'd like, John.

505
01:28:16,242 --> 01:28:19,007
Would you like a back rub with that, John?

506
01:28:20,162 --> 01:28:21,732
You're going to help me.

507
01:28:23,002 --> 01:28:25,209
Why the fuck would I do that?

508
01:28:26,922 --> 01:28:29,402
Because I'm the only one
that can help you.

509
01:28:48,002 --> 01:28:49,413
You're gonna help me out?

510
01:28:50,522 --> 01:28:53,366
That's downright upright of you, Mr. Wick.

511
01:28:54,402 --> 01:28:57,167
You sound positively magnanimous.

512
01:28:58,842 --> 01:29:00,526
But look around you.

513
01:29:00,602 --> 01:29:04,084
How much help does it look like I need?

514
01:29:12,962 --> 01:29:16,045
It seems to me that the real question,
Mr. Wick,

515
01:29:17,282 --> 01:29:21,332
is who in this cruel world of ours...
is going to help you?

516
01:29:36,202 --> 01:29:37,363
There's a storm coming.

517
01:29:37,442 --> 01:29:41,083
Not just for me. For all of us.

518
01:29:41,162 --> 01:29:43,733
For everyone under the Table.

519
01:29:43,802 --> 01:29:47,523
Yes, killing someone who has a seat
at the High Table does create a problem.

520
01:29:47,602 --> 01:29:49,445
But it's your problem, baby.

521
01:29:49,522 --> 01:29:55,052
After all, none of my people
sent Gianna D'Antonio...

522
01:29:55,162 --> 01:29:56,766
to the hereafter.

523
01:29:58,282 --> 01:30:02,173
That being said, Santino has her seat now.

524
01:30:03,162 --> 01:30:04,448
And he wants the city.

525
01:30:05,442 --> 01:30:08,525
When he's done uptown,
you think he's gonna stop at 14th Street?

526
01:30:09,522 --> 01:30:12,526
We'll just have to take care of ourselves.

527
01:30:12,602 --> 01:30:13,808
Oh, yeah?

528
01:30:13,882 --> 01:30:16,283
For how long?

529
01:30:16,362 --> 01:30:17,693
And how much blood?

530
01:30:18,682 --> 01:30:20,411
You kill Santino,

531
01:30:20,482 --> 01:30:23,008
the Camorra,
and the High Table come for you.

532
01:30:24,322 --> 01:30:27,610
I kill Santino, they come for me.

533
01:30:28,962 --> 01:30:31,647
He's offered $7 million for your life.

534
01:30:32,642 --> 01:30:36,966
Seven million dollars
is a lot of money, Mr. Wick.

535
01:30:43,162 --> 01:30:45,130
So I guess you have a choice.

536
01:30:46,122 --> 01:30:47,931
You want a war?

537
01:30:48,002 --> 01:30:50,323
Or do you wanna just give me a gun?

538
01:30:59,842 --> 01:31:05,884
Somebody, please! Get this man a gun!

539
01:31:12,522 --> 01:31:15,446
Kimber 1911, .45 ACP.

540
01:31:17,842 --> 01:31:20,527
Seven-round capacity.

541
01:31:28,922 --> 01:31:30,128
Seven rounds?

542
01:31:31,122 --> 01:31:34,808
Seven million dollars
gets you seven rounds.

543
01:31:36,242 --> 01:31:38,370
That's a million dollars a round, baby.

544
01:31:50,082 --> 01:31:51,083
Let's go.

545
01:31:52,762 --> 01:31:55,413
Your descent into Hell begins here,
Mr. Wick.

546
01:31:55,482 --> 01:31:56,722
He's at the museum.

547
01:31:56,802 --> 01:31:58,452
Earl will guide you.

548
01:31:58,522 --> 01:32:00,763
Do be careful on your way down.

549
01:32:02,162 --> 01:32:05,803
Oh, and remember... you owe me.

550
01:32:07,482 --> 01:32:09,291
You don't want me owing you.

551
01:32:39,362 --> 01:32:40,648
Welcome, everyone.

552
01:32:40,722 --> 01:32:43,885
Let us toast to the future
of the High Table

553
01:32:43,962 --> 01:32:47,125
and of course,
to the memory of my dear sister.

554
01:33:04,362 --> 01:33:06,091
Nice to see you.

555
01:33:16,002 --> 01:33:17,652
Mr. Akoni, how are you?

556
01:34:14,362 --> 01:34:16,091
Wick is here.

557
01:34:16,162 --> 01:34:17,163
Yeah.

558
01:35:08,842 --> 01:35:11,243
You and you, with me. You, go.

559
01:36:26,682 --> 01:36:29,367
Welcome to
"Reflections of the Soul"

560
01:36:29,442 --> 01:36:31,729
at the New Modern NYC.

561
01:36:33,202 --> 01:36:34,886
Within this exhibition,

562
01:36:34,962 --> 01:36:38,205
the interplay of light
and the nature of self-images

563
01:36:38,282 --> 01:36:40,250
coalesce to provide an experience

564
01:36:40,322 --> 01:36:42,484
which will highlight the fragility

565
01:36:42,562 --> 01:36:46,533
of our perception of space
and our place within it.

566
01:36:46,602 --> 01:36:49,845
We hope through this exhibit
we can provide new insights

567
01:36:49,922 --> 01:36:51,970
into your understanding of the world,

568
01:36:52,042 --> 01:36:55,569
and just possibly lead you
to deeper reflection

569
01:36:55,642 --> 01:36:57,246
into the nature of self.

570
01:37:12,202 --> 01:37:15,172
The marker is complete, John.

571
01:37:15,242 --> 01:37:16,846
You should have just run away.

572
01:37:27,442 --> 01:37:29,649
You know what the Camorra will do to you.

573
01:37:31,362 --> 01:37:33,205
You think you're Old Testament?

574
01:37:34,202 --> 01:37:35,613
No, John.

575
01:37:37,962 --> 01:37:38,963
No.

576
01:37:41,522 --> 01:37:43,411
Killing me won't stop the contract.

577
01:37:45,122 --> 01:37:48,968
Killing me will make it so much worse.

578
01:37:51,962 --> 01:37:53,123
John...

579
01:37:54,522 --> 01:37:55,728
you know what I think?

580
01:37:58,362 --> 01:38:00,729
I think you are addicted to it.

581
01:38:00,802 --> 01:38:01,803
To the vengeance.

582
01:38:19,882 --> 01:38:22,533
Welcome to
"Reflections of the Soul"

583
01:38:22,602 --> 01:38:25,492
at the New Modern NYC.

584
01:38:28,242 --> 01:38:29,482
No wife.

585
01:38:31,162 --> 01:38:32,493
No life.

586
01:38:34,762 --> 01:38:35,763
No home.

587
01:38:37,122 --> 01:38:40,683
Vengeance... it's all you have.

588
01:38:42,202 --> 01:38:44,523
You wanted me back.

589
01:38:45,562 --> 01:38:46,609
I'm back.

590
01:41:42,802 --> 01:41:46,170
You are now exiting
"Reflections of the Soul"

591
01:41:46,242 --> 01:41:47,732
at the New Modern NYC.

592
01:41:48,722 --> 01:41:50,929
We hope that your journey
through the exhibit

593
01:41:51,042 --> 01:41:53,773
has been one of reflective contemplation

594
01:41:53,842 --> 01:41:56,368
allowing for a new perspective
and insight.

595
01:42:01,282 --> 01:42:04,445
You are now exiting
"Reflections of the Soul..."

596
01:43:24,042 --> 01:43:27,410
You are now exiting
"Reflections of the Soul..."

597
01:43:40,442 --> 01:43:41,932
Good evening.

598
01:43:43,722 --> 01:43:45,406
Is the manager in?

599
01:43:45,482 --> 01:43:48,850
The manager is always in.

600
01:43:53,962 --> 01:43:54,963
Winston.

601
01:43:56,642 --> 01:43:57,803
Mr. D'Antonio.

602
01:43:59,002 --> 01:44:00,811
Your evening has been colorful, I see.

603
01:44:01,802 --> 01:44:03,964
Seeking safe harbor, I presume?

604
01:44:05,202 --> 01:44:07,569
I want his membership revoked. Now.

605
01:44:07,642 --> 01:44:12,011
In the eyes of this institution,
Mr. Wick has breached no legalities.

606
01:44:12,082 --> 01:44:14,210
Then you know that I have the right
to demand...

607
01:44:14,282 --> 01:44:18,526
Nothing.
You demand nothing of me, Mr. D'Antonio.

608
01:44:18,602 --> 01:44:21,333
This kingdom is mine and mine alone.

609
01:44:24,362 --> 01:44:26,046
All right.

610
01:44:26,122 --> 01:44:28,966
Then enjoy your kingdom, Winston,
while you still can.

611
01:44:29,042 --> 01:44:32,728
And you, its privileges, sir.

612
01:44:45,642 --> 01:44:48,213
I'm here to see Santino D'Antonio.

613
01:44:52,162 --> 01:44:54,529
He's waiting for you in the lounge, sir.

614
01:45:46,042 --> 01:45:47,123
Duck fat.

615
01:45:47,202 --> 01:45:48,772
Makes all the difference.

616
01:45:49,762 --> 01:45:51,252
Jonathan...

617
01:45:51,322 --> 01:45:52,448
Have you seen the menu here?

618
01:45:54,042 --> 01:45:56,409
- Lot of options.
- Jonathan, listen to me...

619
01:45:56,482 --> 01:45:59,929
A man can stay here a long time

620
01:46:00,042 --> 01:46:01,692
and never eat the same meal twice.

621
01:46:02,682 --> 01:46:06,050
Jonathan, just walk away.

622
01:46:08,242 --> 01:46:09,323
Yeah, Jonathan.

623
01:46:09,402 --> 01:46:10,927
Walk a...

624
01:46:18,962 --> 01:46:20,851
What have you done?

625
01:46:24,882 --> 01:46:25,883
Finished it.

626
01:46:44,362 --> 01:46:46,171
How was he?

627
01:46:46,242 --> 01:46:49,132
He was a good dog.
I have enjoyed his company.

628
01:46:54,362 --> 01:46:56,171
Let's go home.

629
01:48:32,562 --> 01:48:33,893
Mr. Wick?

630
01:48:40,362 --> 01:48:42,524
If you would be so inclined.

631
01:49:16,842 --> 01:49:17,843
Come on, boy.

632
01:49:26,642 --> 01:49:29,043
It has been a pleasure, Mr. Wick.

633
01:49:36,042 --> 01:49:37,373
Good bye.

634
01:50:14,442 --> 01:50:15,967
Jonathan.

635
01:50:16,042 --> 01:50:17,203
Winston.

636
01:50:18,882 --> 01:50:20,168
What am I lookin' at?

637
01:50:22,442 --> 01:50:24,968
The Camorra's doubled
Santino's open contract.

638
01:50:25,042 --> 01:50:26,248
It's gone international.

639
01:50:27,482 --> 01:50:28,768
High Table?

640
01:50:28,842 --> 01:50:29,843
Mmm-hmm.

641
01:50:31,442 --> 01:50:32,523
And the Continental?

642
01:50:34,482 --> 01:50:36,530
You killed a man on company grounds,
Jonathan.

643
01:50:36,602 --> 01:50:40,402
You leave me no choice
but to declare you excommunicado.

644
01:50:42,402 --> 01:50:46,293
The doors to any service or provider
in connection with the Continental

645
01:50:46,362 --> 01:50:48,808
are now closed to you.

646
01:50:52,202 --> 01:50:54,204
I am so sorry.

647
01:50:56,242 --> 01:50:58,244
Your life is now forfeit.

648
01:51:00,842 --> 01:51:02,810
Then why am I not dead?

649
01:51:04,122 --> 01:51:06,489
Because I deemed it not to be.

650
01:51:09,482 --> 01:51:10,483
Now.

651
01:51:38,282 --> 01:51:41,491
You have one hour.
I can't delay it any longer.

652
01:51:43,322 --> 01:51:44,767
You might need this...

653
01:51:46,762 --> 01:51:47,763
down the road.

654
01:51:52,402 --> 01:51:53,403
Winston...

655
01:51:55,002 --> 01:51:56,333
tell them.

656
01:51:57,482 --> 01:51:59,484
Tell them all.

657
01:51:59,562 --> 01:52:01,564
Whoever comes,

658
01:52:01,642 --> 01:52:02,973
whoever it is...

659
01:52:04,082 --> 01:52:05,493
I'll kill them.

660
01:52:06,482 --> 01:52:08,132
I'll kill them all.

661
01:52:11,962 --> 01:52:13,373
'Course you will.

662
01:52:17,842 --> 01:52:19,173
Jonathan.

663
01:52:21,162 --> 01:52:22,493
Winston.

664
01:52:45,362 --> 01:52:46,693
Accounts payable.

665
01:52:49,362 --> 01:52:53,367
One-one-one-one-one.

666
01:52:55,362 --> 01:52:57,205
In one hour.

667
01:52:58,202 --> 01:52:59,363
John Wick.

668
01:53:01,042 --> 01:53:02,931
Excommunicado.

669
01:53:26,642 --> 01:53:29,964
Order 11111 confirmed.
