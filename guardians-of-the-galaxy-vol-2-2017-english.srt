1
00:01:06,657 --> 00:01:10,247
There's a girl in this harbor town

2
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:13,450
And she works layin' whiskey down

3
00:01:14,081 --> 00:01:17,871
They say,
"Brandy, fetch another round"

4
00:01:18,043 --> 00:01:21,083
And she serves them
whiskey and wine

5
00:01:21,255 --> 00:01:25,215
The sailors say
"Brandy, you're a fine girl"

6
00:01:25,384 --> 00:01:29,224
"What a good wife you would be"

7
00:01:40,274 --> 00:01:42,064
- Come on!
- Slow down!

8
00:01:42,234 --> 00:01:44,234
This way, my river lily!
Come on!

9
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:48,280
Where are you taking me?

10
00:01:48,448 --> 00:01:49,448
Come on, come on.

11
00:01:49,825 --> 00:01:51,745
Look. Look!

12
00:01:51,910 --> 00:01:53,820
Oh, it's beautiful!

13
00:01:53,996 --> 00:01:56,086
I was afraid
it wouldn't take to the soil...

14
00:01:56,248 --> 00:01:57,498
but it rooted quickly.

15
00:01:57,666 --> 00:02:00,336
And soon, it'll be everywhere.

16
00:02:00,502 --> 00:02:03,502
All across the universe.

17
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:06,850
Well, I don't know what
you're talking about...

18
00:02:07,009 --> 00:02:08,639
but I like the way you say it.

19
00:02:09,094 --> 00:02:10,554
My heart is yours...

20
00:02:11,597 --> 00:02:13,307
Meredith Quill.

21
00:02:14,391 --> 00:02:17,721
I can't believe I fell in love
with a spaceman.

22
00:03:10,405 --> 00:03:12,495
Showtime, a-holes!

23
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,420
It will be here any minute.

24
00:03:15,577 --> 00:03:17,377
Which will be its loss.

25
00:03:17,538 --> 00:03:19,038
I thought your thing was a sword?

26
00:03:19,206 --> 00:03:21,286
We've been hired
to stop an interdimensional beast...

27
00:03:21,416 --> 00:03:24,096
from feeding on those batteries,
and I'm gonna stop it with a sword?

28
00:03:24,294 --> 00:03:26,374
It's just, swords were your thing
and guns were mine.

29
00:03:26,505 --> 00:03:28,148
But I guess we're
both doing guns now.

30
00:03:28,178 --> 00:03:29,215
I just didn't know that.

31
00:03:29,383 --> 00:03:32,713
Drax, why aren't you wearing
one of Rocket's aero-rigs?

32
00:03:32,886 --> 00:03:34,226
It hurts.

33
00:03:34,388 --> 00:03:35,388
It hurts?

34
00:03:36,974 --> 00:03:38,554
I have sensitive nipples.

35
00:03:39,643 --> 00:03:42,313
"My nipples hurt! Oh, goodness me!"

36
00:03:42,479 --> 00:03:44,069
What about him? What's he doing?

37
00:03:44,231 --> 00:03:46,731
I'm finishing this so we can listen to
tunes while we work.

38
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:48,150
How is that a priority?

39
00:03:48,318 --> 00:03:50,698
Blame Quill. He's the one
who loves music so much.

40
00:03:50,863 --> 00:03:52,423
No, I actually agree with Drax on this.

41
00:03:52,573 --> 00:03:53,993
That's hardly important right now.

42
00:03:54,158 --> 00:03:56,538
Okay. Sure, Quill.

43
00:03:56,702 --> 00:03:59,622
No, seriously, I side with Drax.

44
00:03:59,788 --> 00:04:03,128
No, I understand that.
You're being very serious right now.

45
00:04:03,709 --> 00:04:05,469
I can clearly see you winking.

46
00:04:05,752 --> 00:04:08,042
Damn it. I'm using my left eye?

47
00:04:13,886 --> 00:04:15,226
I am Groot.

48
00:04:15,387 --> 00:04:17,517
They were not looking at you funny.

49
00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:23,899
Well, that's intense.

50
00:05:26,208 --> 00:05:27,208
Groot!

51
00:05:42,558 --> 00:05:44,898
Groot, get out of the way!
You're gonna get hurt!

52
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:46,060
Hi.

53
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:30,770
No! Spit it out!

54
00:06:30,939 --> 00:06:32,109
Come on!

55
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:36,520
Disgusting!

56
00:07:38,215 --> 00:07:41,005
The beast's hide is too thick
to be pierced from the outside.

57
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:43,350
I must cut through it from the inside.

58
00:07:43,512 --> 00:07:44,512
Huh?

59
00:07:44,555 --> 00:07:47,015
No, no! Drax, wait a minute!

60
00:07:47,182 --> 00:07:48,182
Drax!

61
00:07:57,901 --> 00:07:59,191
What is he doing?

62
00:07:59,361 --> 00:08:02,191
He said the skin is too thick
to be pierced from the outside, so he...

63
00:08:02,364 --> 00:08:04,217
- That doesn't make any sense!
- I tried telling him that!

64
00:08:04,241 --> 00:08:06,845
Skin is the same level of thickness
from the inside as from the outside!

65
00:08:06,869 --> 00:08:08,579
I realize that.

66
00:08:12,207 --> 00:08:14,377
There is a cut on its neck.

67
00:08:14,543 --> 00:08:16,753
Rocket, get it to look up.

68
00:08:19,006 --> 00:08:21,846
Hey, you giant Sea-Monkey! Up here!

69
00:08:30,559 --> 00:08:32,069
Watch it, Quill!

70
00:09:18,941 --> 00:09:20,941
Yes! I have single-handedly...

71
00:09:21,944 --> 00:09:23,234
vanquished the beast!

72
00:09:26,281 --> 00:09:27,441
What?

73
00:09:37,459 --> 00:09:38,799
What are they called again?

74
00:09:39,253 --> 00:09:40,623
Anulax batteries.

75
00:09:40,796 --> 00:09:43,006
Harbulary batteries.

76
00:09:43,173 --> 00:09:45,463
That's nothing like what I just said.

77
00:09:45,634 --> 00:09:47,434
But they're worth
thousands of units apiece...

78
00:09:47,511 --> 00:09:49,631
which is why the Sovereign hired us
to protect them.

79
00:09:49,805 --> 00:09:51,899
Careful what you say
around these folks.

80
00:09:51,929 --> 00:09:53,185
They're easily offended.

81
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:55,140
The cost of transgression is death.

82
00:09:56,478 --> 00:10:00,488
We thank you, Guardians,
for putting your lives on the line.

83
00:10:00,649 --> 00:10:04,659
We could not risk the lives
of our own Sovereign citizens.

84
00:10:05,487 --> 00:10:09,327
Every citizen is born
exactly as designed by the community.

85
00:10:09,491 --> 00:10:12,661
Impeccable, both physically
and mentally.

86
00:10:12,828 --> 00:10:14,998
We control the DNA of our progeny...

87
00:10:15,164 --> 00:10:17,494
germinating them in birthing pods.

88
00:10:17,666 --> 00:10:21,166
I guess I prefer to make people
the old-fashioned way.

89
00:10:22,671 --> 00:10:24,831
Perhaps someday, you could give me
a history lesson...

90
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:28,510
in the archaic ways of our ancestors.

91
00:10:28,677 --> 00:10:30,807
For academic purposes.

92
00:10:30,971 --> 00:10:32,761
I would be honored, yes.

93
00:10:32,931 --> 00:10:34,931
In the name of research...

94
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:37,600
I think that could be pretty...

95
00:10:37,769 --> 00:10:39,029
repulsive.

96
00:10:39,855 --> 00:10:41,315
I'm not into that kind of casual...

97
00:10:41,482 --> 00:10:42,522
Oh, please.

98
00:10:42,691 --> 00:10:45,981
Your people promised something
in exchange for our services.

99
00:10:46,153 --> 00:10:47,443
Bring it...

100
00:10:47,613 --> 00:10:49,193
and we shall gladly
be on our way.

101
00:11:03,170 --> 00:11:05,550
Family reunion.
Yay.

102
00:11:05,714 --> 00:11:08,214
I understand she is your sister.

103
00:11:08,383 --> 00:11:12,673
She's worth no more to me
than the bounty due for her on Xandar.

104
00:11:13,055 --> 00:11:17,225
Our soldiers apprehended her
attempting to steal the batteries.

105
00:11:18,227 --> 00:11:20,147
Do with her as you please.

106
00:11:23,649 --> 00:11:25,409
We thank you,
High Priestess Ayesha.

107
00:11:25,859 --> 00:11:28,409
What is your heritage, Mr. Quill?

108
00:11:31,698 --> 00:11:33,198
My mother is from Earth.

109
00:11:33,450 --> 00:11:35,240
And your father?

110
00:11:36,745 --> 00:11:39,745
He ain't from Missouri.
That's all I know.

111
00:11:39,915 --> 00:11:41,415
I see it within you.

112
00:11:41,917 --> 00:11:45,087
An unorthodox genealogy.

113
00:11:45,254 --> 00:11:49,464
A hybrid that seems particularly...

114
00:11:50,425 --> 00:11:52,055
reckless.

115
00:11:53,053 --> 00:11:56,093
You know, they told me you people
were conceited douchebags...

116
00:11:57,391 --> 00:11:58,891
but that isn't true at all.

117
00:12:03,939 --> 00:12:04,779
Oh, shit.

118
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:06,950
I'm using my wrong eye again,
aren't I?

119
00:12:07,109 --> 00:12:09,489
I'm sorry. That was meant to be
behind your back.

120
00:12:11,488 --> 00:12:13,208
Count yourself blessed
they didn't kill you.

121
00:12:13,323 --> 00:12:15,073
You're telling me.

122
00:12:15,242 --> 00:12:16,452
You wanna buy some batteries?

123
00:12:29,131 --> 00:12:33,131
All right, let's get baldy to Xandar
and collect that bounty.

124
00:13:25,354 --> 00:13:27,524
That stuff about my father...

125
00:13:27,689 --> 00:13:29,699
Who does she think she is?

126
00:13:29,858 --> 00:13:32,158
I know you're sensitive about that.

127
00:13:32,319 --> 00:13:34,519
I'm not sensitive about it.
I just don't know who he is.

128
00:13:36,198 --> 00:13:39,208
Sorry if it seemed like
I was flirting with the High Priestess.

129
00:13:39,535 --> 00:13:40,915
I wasn't.

130
00:13:41,078 --> 00:13:43,208
I don't care if you were.

131
00:13:43,372 --> 00:13:45,162
Well, I feel like you do care.

132
00:13:45,332 --> 00:13:47,702
That's why I'm apologizing. So, sorry!

133
00:13:47,876 --> 00:13:50,046
Gamora is not the one for you, Quill.

134
00:13:50,879 --> 00:13:52,009
Damn shadow.

135
00:13:52,256 --> 00:13:54,216
There are two types of beings
in the universe...

136
00:13:54,383 --> 00:13:56,093
those who dance, and those who do not.

137
00:13:56,510 --> 00:13:58,220
Mm-hmm.

138
00:13:58,428 --> 00:14:00,388
I first met my beloved at a war rally.

139
00:14:00,556 --> 00:14:01,386
Oh, God.

140
00:14:01,557 --> 00:14:04,517
Everyone in the village flailed about,
dancing.

141
00:14:04,685 --> 00:14:06,355
Except one woman.

142
00:14:06,603 --> 00:14:08,063
My Ovette.

143
00:14:08,856 --> 00:14:11,026
I knew immediately
she was the one for me.

144
00:14:11,191 --> 00:14:13,731
The most melodic song in
the world could be playing.

145
00:14:14,278 --> 00:14:16,578
She wouldn't even tap her foot.

146
00:14:17,406 --> 00:14:19,536
Wouldn't move a muscle.

147
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:22,420
One might assume she was dead.

148
00:14:22,578 --> 00:14:24,038
That does sound pretty hot.

149
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:27,210
It would
make my nether regions engorge.

150
00:14:27,374 --> 00:14:29,254
Okay. I get it, yes.

151
00:14:29,418 --> 00:14:31,218
I'm a dancer, Gamora is not.

152
00:14:31,378 --> 00:14:35,048
You just need to find a woman
who is pathetic... like you.

153
00:14:40,429 --> 00:14:43,269
I'm hungry.
Hand me some of that yaro root.

154
00:14:43,432 --> 00:14:44,932
No. It's not ripe yet...

155
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:46,100
and I hate you.

156
00:14:46,268 --> 00:14:47,478
You hate me?

157
00:14:47,644 --> 00:14:50,314
You left me there
while you stole that stone for yourself.

158
00:14:50,481 --> 00:14:52,641
And yet here you stand, a hero.

159
00:14:52,816 --> 00:14:55,656
I will be free of these shackles
soon enough, and I will kill you.

160
00:14:56,111 --> 00:14:57,321
I swear.

161
00:14:57,488 --> 00:14:58,618
No.

162
00:14:58,780 --> 00:15:02,150
You're gonna live out the rest of your
days in a prison on Xandar...

163
00:15:02,326 --> 00:15:03,746
wishing you could.

164
00:15:10,626 --> 00:15:11,626
This is weird.

165
00:15:11,793 --> 00:15:13,646
We've got a Sovereign
fleet approaching from the rear.

166
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:14,670
Why would they do that?

167
00:15:14,838 --> 00:15:16,608
Probably because Rocket stole
some of their batteries.

168
00:15:16,632 --> 00:15:17,632
Dude!

169
00:15:18,133 --> 00:15:18,963
Right.

170
00:15:19,134 --> 00:15:20,334
He didn't steal some of those.

171
00:15:20,469 --> 00:15:22,750
I don't know why they're after us.
What a mystery this is.

172
00:15:33,315 --> 00:15:35,155
What were you thinking?

173
00:15:35,317 --> 00:15:36,753
Dude, they were really easy to steal!

174
00:15:36,777 --> 00:15:38,157
- That's your defense?
- Come on!

175
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:40,650
You saw how that High Priestess
talked down to us.

176
00:15:40,823 --> 00:15:42,493
Now I'm teaching her a lesson!

177
00:15:43,325 --> 00:15:45,865
I didn't realize your motivation
was altruism.

178
00:15:46,036 --> 00:15:48,636
It's really a shame the Sovereign
have mistaken your intentions...

179
00:15:48,664 --> 00:15:50,344
- and they're trying to kill us.
- Exactly!

180
00:15:50,499 --> 00:15:52,129
I was being sarcastic!

181
00:15:52,292 --> 00:15:53,332
Oh, no!

182
00:15:53,502 --> 00:15:55,902
You're supposed to use
a sarcastic voice! Now I look foolish!

183
00:15:56,213 --> 00:15:57,613
Can we put the bickering on hold...

184
00:15:57,673 --> 00:15:59,673
until after we survive
this massive space battle?

185
00:15:59,842 --> 00:16:01,502
- More incoming!
- Good!

186
00:16:01,677 --> 00:16:03,177
I wanna kill some guys!

187
00:16:11,019 --> 00:16:12,359
You're not killing anyone.

188
00:16:12,521 --> 00:16:14,231
All those ships are remotely piloted.

189
00:16:17,651 --> 00:16:18,651
Damn it!

190
00:16:29,246 --> 00:16:31,166
What is the delay, Admiral?

191
00:16:31,331 --> 00:16:35,371
High Priestess, the batteries,
they are exceptionally combustible...

192
00:16:35,544 --> 00:16:36,855
and could destroy the entire fleet.

193
00:16:36,879 --> 00:16:39,589
Our concern is their slight
against our people.

194
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:43,420
We hired them and they steal from us.

195
00:16:44,553 --> 00:16:46,053
It is heresy of the highest order.

196
00:16:47,890 --> 00:16:49,940
All command modules...

197
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:52,680
fire with the intent to kill.

198
00:17:02,070 --> 00:17:03,900
What's the nearest habitable planet?

199
00:17:04,907 --> 00:17:06,247
It's called Berhert.

200
00:17:06,408 --> 00:17:08,038
- How many jumps?
- Only one.

201
00:17:08,202 --> 00:17:11,282
But the access point is 47 clicks away.

202
00:17:11,455 --> 00:17:14,295
And you have to go through
that quantum asteroid field.

203
00:17:23,717 --> 00:17:25,037
Quill, to make it through that...

204
00:17:25,093 --> 00:17:26,905
you'd have to be the greatest pilot
in the universe.

205
00:17:26,929 --> 00:17:27,929
Lucky for us, I...

206
00:17:28,096 --> 00:17:29,596
I am.

207
00:17:42,277 --> 00:17:43,117
What are you doing?

208
00:17:43,278 --> 00:17:45,288
I've been flying this rig
since I was 10 years old.

209
00:17:45,447 --> 00:17:48,497
I was cybernetically engineered
to pilot a spacecraft.

210
00:17:48,659 --> 00:17:51,289
You were cybernetically engineered
to be a douchebag!

211
00:17:51,787 --> 00:17:52,787
Stop it.

212
00:17:52,955 --> 00:17:54,766
Later on tonight, you're gonna be
laying down in your bed...

213
00:17:54,790 --> 00:17:56,935
and there's gonna be something
squishy in your pillow case.

214
00:17:56,959 --> 00:17:58,478
And you're gonna be like,
"What's this?"

215
00:17:58,502 --> 00:18:00,382
And it's gonna be because
I put a turd in there!

216
00:18:01,964 --> 00:18:04,174
You put your turd in my bed,
I shave you.

217
00:18:04,341 --> 00:18:05,751
It won't be my turd.

218
00:18:05,926 --> 00:18:07,306
It will be Drax's.

219
00:18:09,805 --> 00:18:11,765
I have famously huge turds.

220
00:18:11,932 --> 00:18:14,302
We're about to die,
and this is what we're discussing?

221
00:18:16,979 --> 00:18:17,979
Son of a...

222
00:18:18,147 --> 00:18:19,607
Dude! Seriously!

223
00:18:20,315 --> 00:18:21,315
Hey! Let me...

224
00:18:35,664 --> 00:18:36,994
Idiots!

225
00:18:37,166 --> 00:18:39,046
Well, that's what you get
when Quill flies.

226
00:18:41,503 --> 00:18:43,793
We still have a Sovereign
craft behind us.

227
00:18:46,633 --> 00:18:48,463
Our weapons are down.

228
00:18:48,635 --> 00:18:50,675
20 clicks to the jump!

229
00:18:53,849 --> 00:18:54,849
Hold on.

230
00:19:05,068 --> 00:19:07,198
It's not ripe.

231
00:19:15,037 --> 00:19:17,207
Come on, Zylak. You can do this.

232
00:19:20,709 --> 00:19:22,509
Yes!

233
00:19:23,587 --> 00:19:25,677
15 clicks to the jump!

234
00:19:26,089 --> 00:19:27,219
Come on!

235
00:19:28,008 --> 00:19:29,558
Keep going!

236
00:19:43,774 --> 00:19:44,984
10 clicks!

237
00:19:48,570 --> 00:19:50,320
Die, spaceship!

238
00:19:55,118 --> 00:19:56,418
You suck, Zylak.

239
00:19:56,578 --> 00:19:57,578
Typical.

240
00:20:00,332 --> 00:20:01,332
Five clicks!

241
00:20:07,089 --> 00:20:08,639
Son of a...

242
00:20:09,091 --> 00:20:10,961
They went around the field!

243
00:20:25,274 --> 00:20:27,604
Someone destroyed all our ships!

244
00:20:27,776 --> 00:20:28,986
What?

245
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:33,650
Who?

246
00:20:34,616 --> 00:20:36,036
One click!

247
00:20:37,202 --> 00:20:38,952
- What is that?
- Who cares?

248
00:20:39,121 --> 00:20:40,491
That's the jump point! Go!

249
00:20:44,168 --> 00:20:45,968
It's a guy.

250
00:20:53,135 --> 00:20:53,965
Oh, my God.

251
00:20:54,136 --> 00:20:55,516
He's still out there?

252
00:21:22,664 --> 00:21:24,794
Groot, put your seatbelt on!

253
00:21:25,584 --> 00:21:27,964
Prepare for a really bad landing!

254
00:22:08,585 --> 00:22:10,545
That was awesome!

255
00:22:12,047 --> 00:22:13,047
Yes!

256
00:22:15,092 --> 00:22:16,382
Look at this!

257
00:22:17,136 --> 00:22:18,726
Where is the other half of our ship?

258
00:22:18,887 --> 00:22:19,887
My ship.

259
00:22:20,055 --> 00:22:23,685
Either one of you could have gotten
us through that field... Had you flown

260
00:22:23,851 --> 00:22:26,721
with what's between your ears
instead of what's between your legs!

261
00:22:27,312 --> 00:22:30,142
If what's between my legs
had a hand on it...

262
00:22:30,315 --> 00:22:32,445
I guarantee I could have landed
this ship with it.

263
00:22:33,527 --> 00:22:35,380
Peter, we almost died
because of your arrogance.

264
00:22:35,404 --> 00:22:37,034
More like because he stole...

265
00:22:37,197 --> 00:22:38,407
the Anulax batteries!

266
00:22:38,574 --> 00:22:40,744
They're called Harbulary batteries.

267
00:22:40,909 --> 00:22:42,419
No, they're not!

268
00:22:42,744 --> 00:22:44,454
Do you know why I did it, Star-Munch?

269
00:22:45,205 --> 00:22:46,685
I'm not gonna answer to
"Star-Munch."

270
00:22:46,748 --> 00:22:48,668
I did it because I wanted to!

271
00:22:48,834 --> 00:22:49,584
Dick.

272
00:22:49,751 --> 00:22:51,541
What are we even
talking about this for?

273
00:22:51,712 --> 00:22:54,332
We just had a little man save us
by blowing up 50 ships!

274
00:22:54,506 --> 00:22:55,506
How little?

275
00:22:55,549 --> 00:22:57,429
Well, I don't know, like this?

276
00:22:57,843 --> 00:22:59,423
A little one-inch man saved us?

277
00:22:59,595 --> 00:23:01,835
Well, if he got closer,
I'm sure he would be much larger.

278
00:23:01,972 --> 00:23:04,262
That's how eyesight works,
you stupid raccoon.

279
00:23:04,433 --> 00:23:05,853
Don't call me a raccoon!

280
00:23:06,226 --> 00:23:08,646
I'm sorry. I took it too far.

281
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:10,820
I meant trash panda.

282
00:23:13,108 --> 00:23:14,358
Is that better?

283
00:23:14,818 --> 00:23:16,528
I don't know.

284
00:23:16,695 --> 00:23:18,905
It's worse. It's so much worse.

285
00:23:19,072 --> 00:23:20,362
You son of a...

286
00:23:20,532 --> 00:23:21,242
Hey!

287
00:23:21,408 --> 00:23:22,844
- I've had it with you!
- No! Back up!

288
00:23:22,868 --> 00:23:24,618
Someone followed you through
the jump point.

289
00:23:26,747 --> 00:23:28,877
Set me free, you'll need my help.

290
00:23:29,041 --> 00:23:30,121
I'm not a fool, Nebula.

291
00:23:30,292 --> 00:23:32,353
You are a fool if you deprive yourself
a hand in combat.

292
00:23:32,377 --> 00:23:33,688
You'll attack me
the moment I let you go.

293
00:23:33,712 --> 00:23:34,712
No, I won't.

294
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:38,100
You'd think an evil supervillain
would learn how to properly lie.

295
00:23:38,258 --> 00:23:40,348
I bet it's the one-inch man.

296
00:24:12,209 --> 00:24:16,009
After all these years, I've found you.

297
00:24:16,713 --> 00:24:18,463
And who the hell are you?

298
00:24:19,258 --> 00:24:22,468
I figured my rugged good looks
would make that obvious.

299
00:24:23,804 --> 00:24:25,844
My name is Ego...

300
00:24:27,266 --> 00:24:28,726
and I'm your dad, Peter.

301
00:24:45,117 --> 00:24:46,667
You know what they say...

302
00:24:46,827 --> 00:24:49,787
"You're out of luck
until you've gone duck."

303
00:25:16,523 --> 00:25:17,943
Yondu!

304
00:25:18,650 --> 00:25:20,650
Come on down!

305
00:25:32,289 --> 00:25:34,459
After going around years in circles...

306
00:25:34,625 --> 00:25:36,415
with this woman I end up marrying.

307
00:25:36,585 --> 00:25:39,295
I said, "Aleta, I love you, girl...

308
00:25:39,463 --> 00:25:40,883
"but you're losing your mind!"

309
00:25:41,048 --> 00:25:43,008
Then again, she's always
been that way.

310
00:25:43,175 --> 00:25:44,925
I could never trust her. You know?

311
00:25:45,093 --> 00:25:46,173
Stakar.

312
00:25:50,349 --> 00:25:52,149
It's been some time.

313
00:25:56,188 --> 00:26:00,198
It seems like this establishment
is the wrong kind of disreputable.

314
00:26:06,490 --> 00:26:07,250
- Sir!
- Stakar!

315
00:26:07,407 --> 00:26:09,747
There's a hundred Ravager factions.

316
00:26:09,910 --> 00:26:12,960
You lost the business of 99 of them
by serving one.

317
00:26:13,121 --> 00:26:14,621
Please, sir. Please!

318
00:26:14,790 --> 00:26:16,170
Get away from me.

319
00:26:21,463 --> 00:26:24,293
You can go to hell then!

320
00:26:24,466 --> 00:26:26,716
I don't give a damn
what you think of me!

321
00:26:27,052 --> 00:26:28,842
So what are you following us for?

322
00:26:29,012 --> 00:26:30,490
Because you're gonna listen to
what I gotta say!

323
00:26:30,514 --> 00:26:33,304
I don't gotta listen to nothing!
You betrayed the code!

324
00:26:33,475 --> 00:26:35,315
Ravagers don't deal in kids.

325
00:26:35,477 --> 00:26:38,397
I told you before!
I didn't know what was going on!

326
00:26:38,564 --> 00:26:41,209
You didn't know because you didn't
want to know because it made you rich.

327
00:26:41,233 --> 00:26:45,573
I demand a seat at the table!
I wear these flames, same as you.

328
00:26:45,737 --> 00:26:47,827
You may dress like us...

329
00:26:47,990 --> 00:26:50,500
but you'll never hear the Horns
of Freedom when you die, Yondu.

330
00:26:50,659 --> 00:26:52,499
And the Colors of Ogord...

331
00:26:52,661 --> 00:26:56,081
will never flash over your grave.

332
00:26:57,374 --> 00:26:58,664
If you think...

333
00:26:59,835 --> 00:27:03,005
I take pleasure in exiling you...

334
00:27:04,756 --> 00:27:06,506
you're wrong.

335
00:27:07,676 --> 00:27:10,596
You broke all our hearts.

336
00:27:26,028 --> 00:27:27,528
Pathetic.

337
00:27:28,697 --> 00:27:30,697
First, Quill betrays us...

338
00:27:30,866 --> 00:27:34,116
and Yondu just lets him go scot-free.

339
00:27:35,037 --> 00:27:37,417
We followed him
because he was the one...

340
00:27:37,581 --> 00:27:40,081
who wasn't afraid
to do what needed to be done.

341
00:27:40,250 --> 00:27:42,580
Seems he's goin' soft.

342
00:27:43,045 --> 00:27:45,545
If he's so soft,
why are you whispering?

343
00:27:46,131 --> 00:27:47,961
You know I'm right, Kraglin.

344
00:27:48,133 --> 00:27:52,553
You best be very careful
what you say about our captain.

345
00:27:52,721 --> 00:27:54,221
Who the hell is that?

346
00:28:34,304 --> 00:28:36,014
Yondu Udonta...

347
00:28:36,598 --> 00:28:38,858
I have a proposition for you.

348
00:28:39,351 --> 00:28:41,471
I hired Yondu to pick you up...

349
00:28:41,645 --> 00:28:43,685
when your mother passed away.

350
00:28:43,856 --> 00:28:45,696
But instead of returning you...

351
00:28:45,858 --> 00:28:47,608
Yondu kept you.

352
00:28:47,776 --> 00:28:50,486
I have no clue as to why.

353
00:28:51,488 --> 00:28:52,948
Well, I'll tell you why.

354
00:28:53,115 --> 00:28:55,155
Because I was a
skinny little kid who

355
00:28:55,242 --> 00:28:56,302
could squeeze into
places adults couldn't.

356
00:28:56,326 --> 00:28:57,786
It made it easier for thievin'.

357
00:28:57,953 --> 00:29:01,283
Well, I've been trying to track you down
ever since.

358
00:29:02,124 --> 00:29:03,414
I thought Yondu was your father.

359
00:29:03,584 --> 00:29:05,624
What? We've been together
this whole time...

360
00:29:05,794 --> 00:29:08,584
and you thought Yondu
was my actual blood relative?

361
00:29:08,755 --> 00:29:09,965
You look exactly alike.

362
00:29:10,132 --> 00:29:11,802
One's blue!

363
00:29:13,427 --> 00:29:15,097
No, he's not my father!

364
00:29:15,262 --> 00:29:17,682
Yondu was the guy who abducted me...

365
00:29:17,848 --> 00:29:19,784
kicked the crap out of me
so I could learn to fight...

366
00:29:19,808 --> 00:29:21,858
and kept me in terror by
threatening to eat me.

367
00:29:22,019 --> 00:29:23,319
- Eat you?
- Yeah.

368
00:29:23,479 --> 00:29:25,609
That son of a bitch.

369
00:29:25,772 --> 00:29:27,142
How'd you locate us now?

370
00:29:27,858 --> 00:29:30,868
Even where I reside,
out past the edge of what's known...

371
00:29:31,028 --> 00:29:33,538
we've heard tell about the man
they call Star-Lord.

372
00:29:33,697 --> 00:29:35,997
What say we head out there right now?

373
00:29:36,158 --> 00:29:38,798
Your associates are welcome.
Even that triangle-faced monkey there.

374
00:29:39,661 --> 00:29:40,871
I promise you...

375
00:29:41,455 --> 00:29:43,455
it's unlike any other place
you've ever seen.

376
00:29:44,166 --> 00:29:45,336
And there...

377
00:29:45,834 --> 00:29:49,624
I can explain
your very special heritage.

378
00:29:50,839 --> 00:29:52,679
Finally get to be...

379
00:29:52,841 --> 00:29:55,511
the father I've always wanted to be.

380
00:29:57,012 --> 00:29:58,512
Excuse me.

381
00:29:59,014 --> 00:30:00,344
I've gotta take a whiz.

382
00:30:06,522 --> 00:30:08,352
I'm not buying it.

383
00:30:10,526 --> 00:30:12,196
Let's go take a walk.

384
00:30:18,867 --> 00:30:20,417
I am Mantis.

385
00:30:24,206 --> 00:30:25,706
What are you doing?

386
00:30:25,874 --> 00:30:27,254
Smiling.

387
00:30:28,085 --> 00:30:30,585
I hear it is the thing to do
to make people like you.

388
00:30:31,672 --> 00:30:33,712
Not if you do it like that.

389
00:30:35,384 --> 00:30:38,014
I was raised alone on Ego's planet.

390
00:30:38,178 --> 00:30:42,898
I do not understand
the intricacies of social interaction.

391
00:30:45,227 --> 00:30:48,857
Can I pet your puppy?
It is adorable.

392
00:30:51,692 --> 00:30:52,732
Yes.

393
00:31:01,952 --> 00:31:05,742
That is called a practical joke!

394
00:31:08,917 --> 00:31:11,047
I liked it very much!

395
00:31:11,211 --> 00:31:12,871
I just made it up!

396
00:31:15,883 --> 00:31:16,883
Give me a break!

397
00:31:17,593 --> 00:31:20,071
After all this time, you're gonna
show up, and all of a sudden...

398
00:31:20,095 --> 00:31:21,935
- you wanna be my dad?
- I hear you.

399
00:31:22,097 --> 00:31:24,097
And by the way, this could be a trap.

400
00:31:24,266 --> 00:31:25,806
The Kree purists, the Ravagers...

401
00:31:25,976 --> 00:31:27,646
- they all want us dead.
- I know, but...

402
00:31:27,811 --> 00:31:28,811
But what?

403
00:31:28,937 --> 00:31:31,397
What was that story you told me
about Zardu Hasselfrau?

404
00:31:31,565 --> 00:31:32,565
Who?

405
00:31:32,649 --> 00:31:33,949
He owned a magic boat?

406
00:31:35,903 --> 00:31:37,113
David Hasselhoff?

407
00:31:37,279 --> 00:31:38,279
Right.

408
00:31:38,322 --> 00:31:40,402
Not a magic boat. A talking car.

409
00:31:40,574 --> 00:31:41,614
Why did he talk again?

410
00:31:41,783 --> 00:31:45,243
To help him fight crime,
and to be supportive.

411
00:31:45,412 --> 00:31:47,952
As a child, you would carry his picture
in your pocket...

412
00:31:48,123 --> 00:31:49,843
and you would tell
all the other children...

413
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,120
that he was your father,
but that he was out of town.

414
00:31:52,294 --> 00:31:54,834
Shooting Knight Rider
or touring with his band in Germany.

415
00:31:55,005 --> 00:31:57,484
I told you that when I was drunk.
Why are you bringing that up now?

416
00:31:57,508 --> 00:31:58,508
I love that story.

417
00:31:58,675 --> 00:32:00,635
I hate that story.

418
00:32:00,803 --> 00:32:02,343
It's so sad!

419
00:32:03,138 --> 00:32:07,518
As a kid, I used to see all the other kids
off playing catch with their dad.

420
00:32:07,684 --> 00:32:10,354
And I wanted that,
more than anything in the world!

421
00:32:11,104 --> 00:32:12,814
That's my point, Peter.

422
00:32:13,649 --> 00:32:16,529
What if this man is your Hasselhoff?

423
00:32:19,947 --> 00:32:21,487
If he ends up being evil...

424
00:32:22,866 --> 00:32:24,496
we will just kill him.

425
00:32:32,709 --> 00:32:34,049
You're leaving me with that fox?

426
00:32:34,211 --> 00:32:35,371
He's not a fox.

427
00:32:35,546 --> 00:32:37,546
Shoot her
if she does anything suspicious.

428
00:32:38,632 --> 00:32:41,002
- Or if you feel like it.
- Okay.

429
00:32:42,177 --> 00:32:44,557
It'll be just a couple of days.

430
00:32:44,721 --> 00:32:47,511
We'll be back before Rocket's finished
fixing the ship.

431
00:32:50,811 --> 00:32:52,641
What if the Sovereign come?

432
00:32:52,813 --> 00:32:54,893
There's no way for them to know
we're here. Let's go.

433
00:32:55,023 --> 00:32:56,653
I'm uncertain about parting ways.

434
00:32:56,817 --> 00:32:58,367
God, you're like an old woman.

435
00:32:58,527 --> 00:33:00,237
Because I'm wise?

436
00:33:01,196 --> 00:33:03,156
Why do you have so much luggage?

437
00:33:03,323 --> 00:33:05,493
I don't want Groot playing
with my things.

438
00:33:08,537 --> 00:33:11,207
I hope Daddy isn't as big of a dick
as you, orphan boy.

439
00:33:13,208 --> 00:33:17,048
What is your goal here?
To get everybody to hate you?

440
00:33:17,838 --> 00:33:19,888
Because it's working.

441
00:33:23,260 --> 00:33:28,560
And if you don't love me now
You will never love me again

442
00:33:29,558 --> 00:33:34,728
I can still hear you saying
You would never break the chain

443
00:33:34,897 --> 00:33:37,897
And if you don't love me now

444
00:33:38,066 --> 00:33:41,196
You will never love me again

445
00:33:41,361 --> 00:33:45,241
I can still hear you saying

446
00:33:45,407 --> 00:33:47,457
You would never break the chain

447
00:33:47,618 --> 00:33:50,748
And if you don't love me now

448
00:33:50,913 --> 00:33:53,623
You will never love me again

449
00:33:53,790 --> 00:33:56,750
I can still hear you saying

450
00:33:56,919 --> 00:34:00,469
You would never break the chain

451
00:34:07,304 --> 00:34:09,264
Hey, can I ask you a personal question?

452
00:34:11,141 --> 00:34:13,601
No one has ever asked me
a personal question.

453
00:34:13,936 --> 00:34:15,476
Your antennae, what are they for?

454
00:34:16,146 --> 00:34:17,146
Their purpose?

455
00:34:17,272 --> 00:34:19,102
Yes. Quill and I have a bet.

456
00:34:19,274 --> 00:34:21,484
Dude. You're not supposed to say that!

457
00:34:22,444 --> 00:34:23,524
I say...

458
00:34:23,695 --> 00:34:26,035
if you are about to go through
a doorway that is too low...

459
00:34:26,198 --> 00:34:28,958
your antennae will feel this,
and keep you from being decapitated.

460
00:34:29,117 --> 00:34:31,287
Right. And if it's anything
other than...

461
00:34:31,453 --> 00:34:34,873
you specifically not being decapitated
by a doorway, I win.

462
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:37,540
They are not for feeling doorways.

463
00:34:39,461 --> 00:34:40,501
I think...

464
00:34:40,671 --> 00:34:43,461
they have something
to do with my empathic abilities.

465
00:34:44,049 --> 00:34:45,049
What are those?

466
00:34:45,134 --> 00:34:48,634
If I touch someone,
I can feel their feelings.

467
00:34:49,721 --> 00:34:51,381
- You read minds?
- No.

468
00:34:51,557 --> 00:34:53,857
Telepaths know thoughts.

469
00:34:54,017 --> 00:34:56,517
Empaths feel feelings.

470
00:34:57,813 --> 00:34:58,813
Emotions.

471
00:35:01,316 --> 00:35:02,486
May I?

472
00:35:03,527 --> 00:35:05,077
All right.

473
00:35:13,328 --> 00:35:15,838
You feel love.

474
00:35:17,416 --> 00:35:20,376
Yeah. I guess I feel a general,
unselfish love for just about everybody.

475
00:35:20,544 --> 00:35:21,674
No!

476
00:35:21,837 --> 00:35:23,837
Romantic, sexual love.

477
00:35:24,006 --> 00:35:25,346
No, I don't.

478
00:35:25,507 --> 00:35:27,177
- For her!
- No!

479
00:35:30,512 --> 00:35:31,722
Okay.

480
00:35:34,683 --> 00:35:36,853
She just told everyone your deepest,
darkest secret!

481
00:35:37,019 --> 00:35:39,359
Dude, I think
you're overreacting a little bit!

482
00:35:39,521 --> 00:35:40,891
You must be so embarrassed!

483
00:35:44,735 --> 00:35:46,615
Do me! Do me!

484
00:35:51,867 --> 00:35:54,867
I have never felt such humor!

485
00:35:58,373 --> 00:36:00,413
So unbelievably uncool.

486
00:36:01,752 --> 00:36:02,962
Quill.

487
00:36:05,547 --> 00:36:09,557
Touch me, and the only thing
you're gonna feel is a broken jaw.

488
00:36:14,890 --> 00:36:18,610
I can also alter emotions
to some extent.

489
00:36:18,769 --> 00:36:19,769
Yeah, like what?

490
00:36:20,562 --> 00:36:23,642
If I touch someone who is sad...

491
00:36:23,816 --> 00:36:26,566
I can ease them into contentment
for a short while.

492
00:36:26,735 --> 00:36:30,575
I can make a stubborn
person compliant.

493
00:36:30,739 --> 00:36:33,749
But I mostly use it
to help my master sleep.

494
00:36:33,909 --> 00:36:37,749
He lies awake at night
thinking about his progeny.

495
00:36:39,957 --> 00:36:41,167
Do one of those on me.

496
00:36:45,671 --> 00:36:47,421
Sleep.

497
00:37:40,184 --> 00:37:41,724
I love this song.

498
00:38:13,509 --> 00:38:14,849
There!

499
00:39:35,132 --> 00:39:37,672
Ain't so tough now without
all your toys...

500
00:39:37,843 --> 00:39:38,843
are you?

501
00:39:42,014 --> 00:39:43,094
Move!

502
00:39:59,865 --> 00:40:01,035
Crap.

503
00:40:06,580 --> 00:40:07,960
Hey there, rat!

504
00:40:08,123 --> 00:40:10,583
How's it going, you blue idiot?

505
00:40:10,959 --> 00:40:13,049
Not so bad.

506
00:40:13,212 --> 00:40:15,582
We got ourselves a pretty good
little gig here.

507
00:40:15,756 --> 00:40:18,556
This golden gal with
quite a high opinion of herself...

508
00:40:18,717 --> 00:40:22,637
has offered us a large sum to deliver
you and your pals over to her...

509
00:40:22,805 --> 00:40:25,435
because she wants to kill y'all.

510
00:40:25,599 --> 00:40:26,809
Your friend...

511
00:40:26,975 --> 00:40:28,605
There's too many of them.

512
00:40:28,769 --> 00:40:31,989
He needs my help.
If you care about him...

513
00:40:32,147 --> 00:40:34,897
you need to get me out of these bonds.

514
00:40:35,442 --> 00:40:37,312
They are going to kill him!

515
00:40:37,486 --> 00:40:39,656
I tell you, it was pretty easy
to find you.

516
00:40:39,822 --> 00:40:41,782
I put a tracer
on your ship back there...

517
00:40:41,949 --> 00:40:43,329
during the war over Xandar.

518
00:40:43,826 --> 00:40:46,166
Give me your word
you won't hurt Groot...

519
00:40:46,328 --> 00:40:48,338
and I'll tell you
where the batteries are.

520
00:40:49,081 --> 00:40:51,491
Lucky for you, my word
don't mean squat.

521
00:40:51,959 --> 00:40:54,259
Otherwise, I'd actually hand you over.

522
00:40:54,419 --> 00:40:55,759
Otherwise, you'd what?

523
00:40:56,922 --> 00:40:58,292
We'll take them batteries.

524
00:40:58,465 --> 00:41:02,015
They're worth what?
A quarter mill on the open market?

525
00:41:02,177 --> 00:41:04,517
That Priestess offered us a million.

526
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:07,350
A quarter is only one third of that!

527
00:41:07,516 --> 00:41:08,686
A quarter ain't a third.

528
00:41:08,851 --> 00:41:10,681
A quarter is 25.

529
00:41:10,853 --> 00:41:11,853
No.

530
00:41:11,937 --> 00:41:14,357
We can't even buy a pair of boots
with 25 units.

531
00:41:14,523 --> 00:41:15,353
Enough!

532
00:41:15,524 --> 00:41:20,484
The point is, we ain't stupid enough
to help kill the Guardians of the Galaxy!

533
00:41:20,863 --> 00:41:23,363
The whole dang Nova Corps
would be on us.

534
00:41:23,532 --> 00:41:25,452
That ain't right!

535
00:41:26,201 --> 00:41:29,281
I just gotta say it
this one time, Captain.

536
00:41:29,454 --> 00:41:31,704
No matter how many times
Quill betrays you...

537
00:41:31,874 --> 00:41:34,704
you protect him
like none of the rest of us much matter!

538
00:41:34,877 --> 00:41:35,877
Yeah!

539
00:41:36,044 --> 00:41:37,544
I'm the one what sticks up for you!

540
00:41:37,713 --> 00:41:38,713
Take it easy, Kraglin.

541
00:41:38,881 --> 00:41:41,381
Damn straight, lad. He's gone soft.

542
00:41:41,550 --> 00:41:44,680
Suppose it's time for a change
in leadership.

543
00:41:49,683 --> 00:41:51,933
Put your damn guns down!

544
00:41:52,102 --> 00:41:53,352
Whoa! Whoa!

545
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:56,980
There must be some kind of
peaceful resolution to this, fellas.

546
00:41:57,149 --> 00:42:00,029
Or even a violent one
where I'm standing over there.

547
00:42:19,087 --> 00:42:20,757
Well, hello, boys.

548
00:42:26,428 --> 00:42:28,138
It's not ripe.

549
00:43:12,724 --> 00:43:16,184
Welcome, everyone, to my world.

550
00:43:16,353 --> 00:43:18,773
Wow. You have your own planet?

551
00:43:18,939 --> 00:43:22,739
Come on.
No larger than your Earth's Moon.

552
00:43:22,943 --> 00:43:24,443
Humility.

553
00:43:24,611 --> 00:43:25,981
I like it.

554
00:43:26,363 --> 00:43:28,823
I, too, am extraordinarily humble.

555
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:15,290
You own a planet and can destroy
two dozen spaceships without a suit.

556
00:44:15,954 --> 00:44:17,744
What are you exactly?

557
00:44:18,916 --> 00:44:22,256
I'm what's called
a Celestial, sweetheart.

558
00:44:23,504 --> 00:44:26,084
A Celestial, like a god?

559
00:44:27,758 --> 00:44:29,678
Small "g," son.

560
00:44:29,843 --> 00:44:32,673
At least on the days
I'm feeling humble as Drax.

561
00:44:44,316 --> 00:44:45,316
Whoa!

562
00:44:47,152 --> 00:44:50,482
I don't know where I came from exactly.

563
00:44:50,656 --> 00:44:52,656
First thing I remember is flickering...

564
00:44:53,242 --> 00:44:55,112
adrift in the cosmos utterly...

565
00:44:56,078 --> 00:44:58,628
and entirely alone.

566
00:44:59,706 --> 00:45:01,586
Over millions of years...

567
00:45:01,750 --> 00:45:05,290
I learned to control the molecules
around me.

568
00:45:05,629 --> 00:45:08,799
I grew smarter and stronger.

569
00:45:10,759 --> 00:45:13,729
And I continued building from there...

570
00:45:13,887 --> 00:45:15,977
layer by layer...

571
00:45:16,140 --> 00:45:18,770
the very planet you walk on now.

572
00:45:18,934 --> 00:45:20,224
Whoa.

573
00:45:20,853 --> 00:45:22,063
But I wanted more.

574
00:45:23,188 --> 00:45:24,858
I desired...

575
00:45:25,399 --> 00:45:26,529
meaning.

576
00:45:27,693 --> 00:45:31,653
"There must be some life out there
in the universe...

577
00:45:31,822 --> 00:45:34,612
"besides just me," I thought.

578
00:45:34,783 --> 00:45:38,783
And so, I set myself the task
of finding it.

579
00:45:39,121 --> 00:45:40,581
I created...

580
00:45:40,747 --> 00:45:44,377
what I imagined biological life
to be like...

581
00:45:44,543 --> 00:45:48,293
down to the most minute detail.

582
00:45:49,423 --> 00:45:50,713
Did you make a penis?

583
00:45:50,883 --> 00:45:52,133
Dude!

584
00:45:52,301 --> 00:45:53,461
What is wrong with you?

585
00:45:53,635 --> 00:45:56,725
If he is a planet, how could he
make a baby with your mother?

586
00:45:56,889 --> 00:45:57,889
He would smush her!

587
00:46:00,100 --> 00:46:02,260
I don't need to hear how my parents...

588
00:46:03,479 --> 00:46:04,479
Why?

589
00:46:05,272 --> 00:46:07,522
My father would tell the
story of impregnating

590
00:46:07,608 --> 00:46:08,988
my mother every winter solstice.

591
00:46:09,026 --> 00:46:10,446
That's disgusting.

592
00:46:10,611 --> 00:46:12,071
It was beautiful.

593
00:46:13,322 --> 00:46:14,862
You Earthers have hang-ups.

594
00:46:15,407 --> 00:46:17,537
Yes, Drax, I got a penis.

595
00:46:18,368 --> 00:46:19,368
Thank you!

596
00:46:19,536 --> 00:46:20,706
It's not half bad.

597
00:46:22,498 --> 00:46:26,048
I've also got pain receptors,
and a digestive system...

598
00:46:26,210 --> 00:46:28,010
and all the accompanying junk.

599
00:46:28,462 --> 00:46:33,092
I wanted to experience
what it truly meant to be human...

600
00:46:33,258 --> 00:46:36,268
as I set out amongst the stars...

601
00:46:36,929 --> 00:46:39,099
until I found...

602
00:46:39,264 --> 00:46:40,974
what I sought.

603
00:46:42,518 --> 00:46:43,688
Life.

604
00:46:45,437 --> 00:46:47,857
I was not alone in the universe
after all.

605
00:46:54,571 --> 00:46:56,401
When did you meet my mother?

606
00:47:00,577 --> 00:47:02,327
Not long after.

607
00:47:08,001 --> 00:47:12,671
It was with Meredith
that I first experienced love.

608
00:47:16,552 --> 00:47:19,722
I called her my river lily.

609
00:47:24,017 --> 00:47:26,607
And from that love, Peter...

610
00:47:30,149 --> 00:47:31,359
you.

611
00:47:38,657 --> 00:47:42,167
I have searched for you for so long.

612
00:47:43,745 --> 00:47:45,455
And when I heard of a man from Earth...

613
00:47:45,622 --> 00:47:49,372
who held an Infinity Stone
in his hand without dying...

614
00:47:51,128 --> 00:47:54,178
I knew you must be the son
of the woman I loved.

615
00:47:55,674 --> 00:47:58,094
If you loved her, why did you leave her?

616
00:48:19,156 --> 00:48:21,036
This is mutiny!

617
00:48:21,825 --> 00:48:24,115
This is mutiny!

618
00:48:24,286 --> 00:48:26,876
This is mutiny!

619
00:48:38,634 --> 00:48:40,054
You're scum!

620
00:49:15,796 --> 00:49:16,796
Captain!

621
00:49:16,839 --> 00:49:19,349
Help me! Please!

622
00:49:19,508 --> 00:49:21,098
Captain!

623
00:49:24,346 --> 00:49:26,096
You're the one what killed those men...

624
00:49:26,640 --> 00:49:28,470
by leading them down the wrong path.

625
00:49:29,351 --> 00:49:31,061
Because you're weak.

626
00:49:33,438 --> 00:49:35,028
And stupid!

627
00:49:37,067 --> 00:49:39,027
It's time for the Ravagers...

628
00:49:39,194 --> 00:49:43,034
to rise once again to glory
with a new captain...

629
00:49:43,824 --> 00:49:45,494
Taserface!

630
00:49:53,167 --> 00:49:56,797
I'm sorry. Your name is...

631
00:49:56,962 --> 00:49:58,672
It's Taserface?

632
00:49:59,089 --> 00:50:00,389
That's right.

633
00:50:00,757 --> 00:50:03,137
Do you shoot tasers out of your face?

634
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:05,630
It's metaphorical!

635
00:50:05,804 --> 00:50:06,804
Yeah!

636
00:50:10,309 --> 00:50:11,309
For what?

637
00:50:13,604 --> 00:50:16,184
For it is a name what strikes fear...

638
00:50:16,356 --> 00:50:19,156
into the hearts of anyone what hears it.

639
00:50:21,820 --> 00:50:23,070
Okay.

640
00:50:23,655 --> 00:50:24,865
Okay...

641
00:50:25,032 --> 00:50:26,282
whatever you say.

642
00:50:26,783 --> 00:50:28,033
You shut up.

643
00:50:28,202 --> 00:50:29,492
You're next.

644
00:50:29,786 --> 00:50:33,876
Udonta, I have waited
a long time to do...

645
00:50:34,041 --> 00:50:35,041
What?

646
00:50:36,168 --> 00:50:39,088
I'm sorry. I am so sorry!

647
00:50:39,254 --> 00:50:42,254
I just keep imagining you
waking up in the morning, sir...

648
00:50:42,424 --> 00:50:45,424
looking in the mirror and then
in all seriousness saying to yourself...

649
00:50:45,594 --> 00:50:49,304
"You know what would be
a really kick-ass name? Taserface!"

650
00:50:51,600 --> 00:50:54,320
That's how I hear you in my head!

651
00:50:55,103 --> 00:50:57,273
What was your second choice?

652
00:50:57,439 --> 00:50:58,489
Scrotum Hat?

653
00:51:01,610 --> 00:51:04,200
New plan. We're killing you first.

654
00:51:05,614 --> 00:51:08,704
Well, dying is certainly better
than having to live an entire life...

655
00:51:08,867 --> 00:51:12,787
as a moronic shitbag who thinks
Taserface is a cool name.

656
00:51:12,955 --> 00:51:15,875
That's enough killing for today.

657
00:51:19,837 --> 00:51:21,467
She's the daughter of Thanos.

658
00:51:23,882 --> 00:51:25,922
I thought you were the biggest sadist
in the galaxy.

659
00:51:26,051 --> 00:51:28,881
That was when Daddy
was paying my bills.

660
00:51:29,054 --> 00:51:32,644
The Priestess wants to
kill the fox herself.

661
00:51:32,808 --> 00:51:35,818
And he has bounties on his head
in at least 12 Kree provinces.

662
00:51:37,479 --> 00:51:38,859
I assure you...

663
00:51:39,022 --> 00:51:41,812
I am not as easy a mark as an old man
without his magic stick...

664
00:51:41,984 --> 00:51:43,864
or a talking woodland beast.

665
00:51:45,237 --> 00:51:47,157
I want 10% of the take...

666
00:51:48,824 --> 00:51:50,534
and a couple more things.

667
00:51:52,369 --> 00:51:53,999
We got a whole box of hands...

668
00:51:54,163 --> 00:51:55,993
- if that one don't work out.
- It is fine.

669
00:51:56,165 --> 00:51:59,375
You think them Kree
is gonna execute the captain?

670
00:51:59,543 --> 00:52:03,753
The Kree consider themselves merciful.
It will be painless.

671
00:52:03,922 --> 00:52:07,342
Well, here it is.
It's the best ship we got.

672
00:52:07,509 --> 00:52:09,179
Location of Ego's planet in the nav.

673
00:52:09,344 --> 00:52:11,684
We'll wire you the 10% once we's paid.

674
00:52:11,847 --> 00:52:14,017
What are you gonna
do with your share?

675
00:52:14,892 --> 00:52:15,762
As a child, my father would have

676
00:52:15,851 --> 00:52:19,101
Gamora and me battle
one another in training.

677
00:52:19,897 --> 00:52:22,197
Every time my sister prevailed...

678
00:52:22,357 --> 00:52:25,697
my father would replace a piece of me
with machinery...

679
00:52:25,861 --> 00:52:28,531
claiming he wanted me to be her equal.

680
00:52:29,615 --> 00:52:31,445
But she won...

681
00:52:31,617 --> 00:52:36,457
again and again, and again,
never once refraining.

682
00:52:38,040 --> 00:52:40,420
So after I murder my sister...

683
00:52:40,584 --> 00:52:43,794
I will buy a warship with
every conceivable instrument of death.

684
00:52:43,962 --> 00:52:47,592
I will hunt my father like a dog,
and I will tear him apart slowly...

685
00:52:47,758 --> 00:52:49,218
piece by piece...

686
00:52:49,384 --> 00:52:52,764
until he knows some semblance
of the profound and unceasing pain...

687
00:52:52,930 --> 00:52:56,100
I know every single day.

688
00:52:57,893 --> 00:52:59,223
Yeah.

689
00:52:59,728 --> 00:53:01,568
I was talking about,
like, a pretty necklace.

690
00:53:02,314 --> 00:53:04,234
Or a nice hat.

691
00:53:04,399 --> 00:53:07,239
Something to make the other girls go,
"Ooh, that's nice!"

692
00:53:11,073 --> 00:53:14,243
Anyways, happy trails.

693
00:53:22,084 --> 00:53:25,624
My mother told everyone
my father was from the stars.

694
00:53:27,297 --> 00:53:29,797
She had brain cancer, so
everyone thought she was delusional.

695
00:53:29,967 --> 00:53:30,967
Peter...

696
00:53:31,135 --> 00:53:33,071
Listen, I'd love to believe all of this,
I really would.

697
00:53:33,095 --> 00:53:34,425
But you left...

698
00:53:34,596 --> 00:53:37,476
the most wonderful woman ever...

699
00:53:37,641 --> 00:53:39,101
to die alone.

700
00:53:39,268 --> 00:53:42,688
I didn't want to
leave your mother, Peter.

701
00:53:42,855 --> 00:53:45,025
If I don't return regularly
to my planet...

702
00:53:45,190 --> 00:53:46,600
and the light within it...

703
00:53:46,775 --> 00:53:48,275
this form will wither and perish.

704
00:53:48,443 --> 00:53:50,483
So why didn't you come back?
Why did you send Yondu?

705
00:53:50,654 --> 00:53:52,614
A criminal, of all people,
to come and fetch me?

706
00:53:52,990 --> 00:53:54,870
I loved your mother, Peter!

707
00:53:55,033 --> 00:53:57,453
I couldn't stand to set foot
on an Earth...

708
00:53:57,619 --> 00:54:00,459
where she wasn't living!
You can't imagine what that's like!

709
00:54:00,622 --> 00:54:03,042
I know exactly what that feels like!

710
00:54:03,208 --> 00:54:04,958
I had to watch her die!

711
00:54:09,339 --> 00:54:13,469
Over the millions and millions of years
of my existence...

712
00:54:13,635 --> 00:54:16,135
I've made many mistakes, Peter.

713
00:54:16,972 --> 00:54:19,182
But you're not one of them.

714
00:54:20,976 --> 00:54:24,726
Please give me the chance to be
the father she would want me to be.

715
00:54:29,985 --> 00:54:34,735
There's so much that I need to
teach you about this planet...

716
00:54:34,907 --> 00:54:36,657
and the light within.

717
00:54:36,992 --> 00:54:40,162
They are a part of you, Peter.

718
00:54:41,038 --> 00:54:42,708
What do you mean?

719
00:54:43,499 --> 00:54:45,419
Give me your hands, son.

720
00:54:46,376 --> 00:54:47,506
Here.

721
00:54:48,378 --> 00:54:50,258
Hold them like that.

722
00:54:56,178 --> 00:54:59,018
Now, close your eyes and concentrate.

723
00:55:00,182 --> 00:55:03,222
Take your brain
to the center of this planet.

724
00:55:08,106 --> 00:55:08,946
Yes!

725
00:55:09,107 --> 00:55:10,107
Yes!

726
00:55:10,359 --> 00:55:12,029
Whoa!

727
00:55:12,194 --> 00:55:13,614
Yes! It's okay.

728
00:55:13,779 --> 00:55:14,869
Just relax. Concentrate.

729
00:55:15,030 --> 00:55:17,190
You can do it. Bring it back.

730
00:55:17,699 --> 00:55:18,789
Yes!

731
00:55:20,410 --> 00:55:23,200
Yes, now shape it.

732
00:55:23,539 --> 00:55:25,249
Feel that energy.

733
00:55:29,419 --> 00:55:30,429
Yes.

734
00:55:34,716 --> 00:55:36,096
You're home.

735
00:55:38,595 --> 00:55:39,725
Peter...

736
00:56:14,256 --> 00:56:17,176
How did you get to this weird,
dumb planet?

737
00:56:17,759 --> 00:56:20,639
Ego found me in my larva state.

738
00:56:20,804 --> 00:56:22,304
Orphaned on my homeworld.

739
00:56:23,265 --> 00:56:25,935
He raised me by hand,
and kept me as his own.

740
00:56:27,352 --> 00:56:28,772
So you're a pet?

741
00:56:29,938 --> 00:56:31,278
I suppose.

742
00:56:32,774 --> 00:56:35,154
People usually want cute pets.

743
00:56:35,319 --> 00:56:37,619
Why would Ego want
such a hideous one?

744
00:56:37,779 --> 00:56:39,039
I am hideous?

745
00:56:39,198 --> 00:56:41,448
You are horrifying to look at. Yes.

746
00:56:44,536 --> 00:56:45,706
But that's a good thing.

747
00:56:47,206 --> 00:56:48,846
When you're ugly,
and someone loves you...

748
00:56:48,957 --> 00:56:51,457
you know they love you
for who you are.

749
00:56:52,794 --> 00:56:55,214
Beautiful people never know
who to trust.

750
00:56:56,131 --> 00:56:59,051
Well, then I'm certainly grateful
to be ugly.

751
00:57:00,511 --> 00:57:03,631
Those pools, they remind me of a time...

752
00:57:03,806 --> 00:57:07,396
when I took my daughter
to the forgotten lakes of my homeworld.

753
00:57:08,560 --> 00:57:09,890
She was like you.

754
00:57:10,312 --> 00:57:11,812
Disgusting?

755
00:57:12,815 --> 00:57:13,985
Innocent.

756
00:57:47,266 --> 00:57:48,266
Drax?

757
00:57:49,893 --> 00:57:51,563
There's something I must tell you.

758
00:58:00,028 --> 00:58:01,028
What's going on?

759
00:58:01,196 --> 00:58:03,116
This gross bug lady is my new friend.

760
00:58:03,282 --> 00:58:06,742
I'm learning many things,
like I'm a pet and ugly.

761
00:58:07,077 --> 00:58:08,707
You're not ugly. Drax!

762
00:58:08,871 --> 00:58:10,081
What are you talking about?

763
00:58:10,247 --> 00:58:11,417
Mantis...

764
00:58:11,874 --> 00:58:14,044
can you show us
where we'll be staying?

765
00:58:14,543 --> 00:58:16,303
Why are there no other beings
on this planet?

766
00:58:16,461 --> 00:58:18,541
The planet is Ego.

767
00:58:18,714 --> 00:58:20,964
A dog would not invite a flea
to live on his back.

768
00:58:21,717 --> 00:58:22,967
And you're not a flea?

769
00:58:23,135 --> 00:58:25,425
I'm a flea with a purpose.

770
00:58:26,054 --> 00:58:27,724
I help him sleep.

771
00:58:28,891 --> 00:58:32,061
What were you about to say to Drax
before I walked out?

772
00:58:37,065 --> 00:58:38,235
Nothing.

773
00:58:39,067 --> 00:58:40,987
Your quarters are this way.

774
00:58:48,577 --> 00:58:52,127
We deliver you to the Kree
in the morning.

775
00:58:54,416 --> 00:58:57,586
Neither one of you will last
much longer after that.

776
00:58:58,212 --> 00:59:00,252
Okay, Taserface.

777
00:59:00,923 --> 00:59:02,963
Hey, tell the other guys we said...

778
00:59:03,133 --> 00:59:04,593
"Hi," Taserface!

779
00:59:09,765 --> 00:59:12,265
What about this little plant?
Can I smash it with a rock?

780
00:59:12,434 --> 00:59:13,934
No, Gef.

781
00:59:14,102 --> 00:59:15,812
It's too adorable to kill.

782
00:59:15,979 --> 00:59:17,899
Take it to the tailor.

783
00:59:19,399 --> 00:59:22,779
No offense, but your employees
are a bunch of jerks.

784
00:59:25,113 --> 00:59:29,903
I was a Kree battle slave for 20 years
when Stakar freed me.

785
00:59:32,454 --> 00:59:35,124
He offered me a place
with the Ravagers.

786
00:59:35,290 --> 00:59:39,710
He said all I needed to do
was adhere to the code.

787
00:59:39,878 --> 00:59:41,628
But I was young...

788
00:59:42,631 --> 00:59:46,091
and greedy, and stupid.

789
00:59:47,052 --> 00:59:49,132
Like you stealing those batteries.

790
00:59:49,304 --> 00:59:50,884
That was mostly Drax.

791
00:59:52,307 --> 00:59:55,817
Me and Stakar and the other captains...

792
00:59:56,812 --> 00:59:59,142
we weren't so different from you
and your friends.

793
01:00:00,107 --> 01:00:01,987
The only family I ever had.

794
01:00:03,402 --> 01:00:05,112
When I broke the code...

795
01:00:07,322 --> 01:00:08,992
they exiled me.

796
01:00:10,325 --> 01:00:11,825
This is what I deserve.

797
01:00:11,994 --> 01:00:13,664
Slow down, drama queen.

798
01:00:13,829 --> 01:00:15,499
You might deserve this,
but I don't.

799
01:00:15,664 --> 01:00:17,454
We gotta get outta here.

800
01:00:18,917 --> 01:00:20,127
Where's Quill?

801
01:00:20,294 --> 01:00:21,834
He went off with his old man.

802
01:00:23,505 --> 01:00:25,135
- Ego?
- Yeah.

803
01:00:25,299 --> 01:00:27,389
It's a day for dumbass names.

804
01:00:30,429 --> 01:00:32,849
You're smiling.
And for a second, I got a warm feeling.

805
01:00:33,015 --> 01:00:35,685
But then it was ruined
by those disgusting-ass teeth.

806
01:00:35,851 --> 01:00:38,221
You like a professional
asshole or what?

807
01:00:38,395 --> 01:00:39,395
Pretty much a pro.

808
01:00:39,521 --> 01:00:42,351
Why didn't you deliver Quill to Ego
like you promised?

809
01:00:42,900 --> 01:00:44,610
He was skinny.

810
01:00:44,985 --> 01:00:49,195
Could fit into places we couldn't.
Good for thievin'.

811
01:00:54,119 --> 01:00:57,339
I got an idea on how to get outta here.

812
01:00:58,207 --> 01:01:00,707
But we're gonna need your little friend.

813
01:01:01,877 --> 01:01:04,337
Mascot, mascot, mascot...

814
01:01:15,390 --> 01:01:17,680
Little fellow's all worked up!
He needs a drink!

815
01:01:23,774 --> 01:01:26,484
Look how cute it is
when it's all riled up.

816
01:01:26,652 --> 01:01:28,522
He's goddang precious!

817
01:01:42,584 --> 01:01:44,294
Hey, twig!

818
01:01:44,628 --> 01:01:46,088
Come here.

819
01:01:46,505 --> 01:01:47,715
Come on.

820
01:01:54,304 --> 01:01:55,304
Aw, man...

821
01:01:55,389 --> 01:01:56,979
what did they do to you?

822
01:02:00,060 --> 01:02:02,520
Hey, you wanna help us get outta here?

823
01:02:03,313 --> 01:02:06,483
There's something I need you to get,
and bring back to me.

824
01:02:06,650 --> 01:02:10,770
In the captain's quarters,
there's a prototype fin...

825
01:02:10,946 --> 01:02:12,576
the thing I wore on my head.

826
01:02:13,240 --> 01:02:17,330
There's a drawer next to the bunk.
It's in that. It's red.

827
01:02:17,494 --> 01:02:18,784
You got it?

828
01:02:52,446 --> 01:02:53,986
That's my underwears.

829
01:02:54,156 --> 01:02:56,301
Yeah, I was pretty sure he didn't know
what you were talkin' about.

830
01:02:56,325 --> 01:02:58,455
You have to explain it more careful.

831
01:02:59,953 --> 01:03:03,373
It's a prototype fin.

832
01:03:08,837 --> 01:03:11,587
That's an orloni. It's a fin, Groot.

833
01:03:11,757 --> 01:03:13,427
You explain it this time.

834
01:03:14,593 --> 01:03:16,133
All right.

835
01:03:16,845 --> 01:03:18,725
That's Vorker's eye.

836
01:03:18,889 --> 01:03:20,899
He takes it out when he sleeps.

837
01:03:21,058 --> 01:03:22,398
Go. Look again.

838
01:03:22,559 --> 01:03:23,979
But leave the eye here.

839
01:03:24,603 --> 01:03:25,433
Why?

840
01:03:25,604 --> 01:03:26,984
He's gonna wake up tomorrow...

841
01:03:27,147 --> 01:03:29,487
and he's not gonna know...

842
01:03:29,650 --> 01:03:31,490
where his eye is!

843
01:03:38,116 --> 01:03:39,706
That's a desk.

844
01:03:39,868 --> 01:03:42,668
We told you it was this big.

845
01:03:48,544 --> 01:03:50,714
Tell me you guys have
a refrigerator somewhere...

846
01:03:50,879 --> 01:03:53,599
with a bunch of severed human toes.

847
01:03:53,757 --> 01:03:57,467
Okay. Then let's just agree
to never discuss this.

848
01:04:00,639 --> 01:04:04,269
The drawer you wanna open
has this symbol on it.

849
01:04:04,434 --> 01:04:05,814
Okay?

850
01:04:14,361 --> 01:04:16,231
What? No!

851
01:04:16,405 --> 01:04:17,757
He thinks you want him
to wear it as a hat.

852
01:04:17,781 --> 01:04:18,991
That's not what I said!

853
01:04:19,158 --> 01:04:21,288
- I am Groot.
- He's relieved you don't want him to.

854
01:04:21,451 --> 01:04:22,911
- I am Groot.
- He hates hats.

855
01:04:23,078 --> 01:04:23,878
I am Groot.

856
01:04:24,037 --> 01:04:25,157
On anyone, not just himself.

857
01:04:25,289 --> 01:04:26,129
I am Groot.

858
01:04:26,290 --> 01:04:28,268
One minute you think someone
has a weird-shaped head...

859
01:04:28,292 --> 01:04:31,146
the next minute it's just because
you realize part of that head is the hat.

860
01:04:31,170 --> 01:04:32,550
That's why you don't like hats?

861
01:04:33,630 --> 01:04:36,000
This is an important conversation
right now?

862
01:05:12,753 --> 01:05:13,753
That ain't it.

863
01:05:23,555 --> 01:05:25,095
I didn't mean to do a mutiny.

864
01:05:28,060 --> 01:05:29,900
They killed all my friends.

865
01:05:33,941 --> 01:05:36,521
Get the third quadrant ready
for release.

866
01:05:43,242 --> 01:05:44,242
One more thing.

867
01:05:45,994 --> 01:05:48,414
You got any clones of Quill's old music
on the ship?

868
01:06:39,214 --> 01:06:40,214
He's got it!

869
01:06:40,382 --> 01:06:41,882
Yondu's got the fin!

870
01:06:42,050 --> 01:06:43,050
Go!

871
01:07:24,551 --> 01:07:25,551
Down there!

872
01:09:24,129 --> 01:09:25,589
You maniac.

873
01:09:27,508 --> 01:09:29,808
The whole ship's gonna blow.

874
01:09:39,645 --> 01:09:41,225
Not the whole ship.

875
01:09:58,288 --> 01:09:59,338
Who is this?

876
01:09:59,498 --> 01:10:03,798
I am sending you the coordinates
for Yondu's ship.

877
01:10:04,253 --> 01:10:06,043
- Release the quadrant!
- Aye, Captain!

878
01:10:06,213 --> 01:10:08,713
I only ask one thing.

879
01:10:09,216 --> 01:10:10,846
That your High Priestess...

880
01:10:11,009 --> 01:10:14,599
tell him the name of the man
what sealed his fate.

881
01:10:15,556 --> 01:10:17,596
Taserface!

882
01:10:41,039 --> 01:10:42,299
Where to, Captain?

883
01:10:42,457 --> 01:10:43,457
Ego.

884
01:10:45,085 --> 01:10:46,295
No, boy!

885
01:10:54,011 --> 01:10:58,551
It ain't healthy for a mammalian body
to hop more than 50 jumps at a time.

886
01:10:58,724 --> 01:10:59,724
I know that.

887
01:10:59,850 --> 01:11:02,360
We are about to do 700!

888
01:11:16,074 --> 01:11:18,324
So I guess this could all
be mine someday.

889
01:11:19,578 --> 01:11:22,208
Rocket? Rocket, are you there?

890
01:11:29,338 --> 01:11:31,048
What are you doing, Peter?

891
01:11:33,342 --> 01:11:34,712
Dance with me.

892
01:11:34,885 --> 01:11:36,345
I'm not going to dance with you.

893
01:11:36,512 --> 01:11:38,262
This is Sam Cooke...

894
01:11:38,806 --> 01:11:41,976
one of the greatest Earth singers
of all time.

895
01:12:11,129 --> 01:12:13,139
Drax thinks you're not a dancer.

896
01:12:14,258 --> 01:12:16,808
If you ever tell anyone about this...

897
01:12:16,969 --> 01:12:18,389
I will kill you.

898
01:12:19,138 --> 01:12:23,018
When are we gonna do something
about this unspoken thing between us?

899
01:12:23,642 --> 01:12:25,062
What unspoken thing?

900
01:12:26,520 --> 01:12:28,190
This...

901
01:12:28,355 --> 01:12:31,145
Cheers, Sam and Diane...

902
01:12:31,316 --> 01:12:33,906
a guy and a girl on a TV show
who dig each other...

903
01:12:34,069 --> 01:12:36,629
but never say it because if they do,
the ratings would go down...

904
01:12:36,780 --> 01:12:37,820
sort of thing.

905
01:12:37,990 --> 01:12:39,450
There's no unspoken thing.

906
01:12:41,368 --> 01:12:44,668
Well, it's a catch-22, because if you
said it, then it would be spoken...

907
01:12:44,830 --> 01:12:47,590
and you would be a liar.
So, by not saying it...

908
01:12:47,749 --> 01:12:51,879
you are telling the truth,
and admitting that there is.

909
01:12:52,045 --> 01:12:53,965
No, that's not what I...

910
01:12:56,300 --> 01:13:00,350
What we should be discussing right
now is something about this place.

911
01:13:00,512 --> 01:13:02,302
It doesn't feel right.

912
01:13:02,764 --> 01:13:04,934
What are you talking about?

913
01:13:05,100 --> 01:13:06,494
You're the one who wanted me
to come here!

914
01:13:06,518 --> 01:13:07,768
That girl Mantis...

915
01:13:07,936 --> 01:13:09,106
she's afraid of something.

916
01:13:09,438 --> 01:13:11,608
Why are you trying to take this
away from me?

917
01:13:11,773 --> 01:13:12,853
I'm not trying...

918
01:13:13,025 --> 01:13:14,945
He's my father. He's blood.

919
01:13:15,110 --> 01:13:16,754
You have blood on Earth
and you never wanted to return there.

920
01:13:16,778 --> 01:13:19,038
Again, you made me come here!

921
01:13:19,198 --> 01:13:21,259
And Earth is the place
where my mother died in front of me.

922
01:13:21,283 --> 01:13:23,993
No, it's because that place is real,
and this is a fantasy.

923
01:13:24,161 --> 01:13:26,831
This is real! I'm only half human,
remember?

924
01:13:26,997 --> 01:13:28,457
That's the half I'm worried about.

925
01:13:28,999 --> 01:13:30,669
I get it. You're jealous...

926
01:13:30,834 --> 01:13:33,164
because I'm part-god,
and you like when I'm the weak one.

927
01:13:33,337 --> 01:13:35,967
You were insufferable to begin with.

928
01:13:36,131 --> 01:13:37,317
I haven't been able to reach Rocket.

929
01:13:37,341 --> 01:13:38,943
I'm gonna go outside,
and I'm gonna try and get a signal.

930
01:13:38,967 --> 01:13:41,807
You know what?
This is not Cheers after all!

931
01:13:41,970 --> 01:13:44,800
This is whatever the show is where
one person is willing...

932
01:13:44,973 --> 01:13:46,573
to open themselves up
to new possibility,

933
01:13:46,642 --> 01:13:48,472
and the other person is a jerk...

934
01:13:48,560 --> 01:13:52,230
who doesn't trust anybody!
It's a show that doesn't exist.

935
01:13:52,397 --> 01:13:53,897
That's why it would get zero ratings!

936
01:13:54,316 --> 01:13:56,316
I don't know what Cheers is!

937
01:13:56,652 --> 01:13:59,692
I finally found my family.
Don't you understand that?

938
01:14:00,864 --> 01:14:02,494
I thought you already had.

939
01:14:32,020 --> 01:14:33,220
Damn it.

940
01:15:06,388 --> 01:15:07,478
Psychopath!

941
01:17:17,853 --> 01:17:19,683
Are you kidding me?

942
01:17:46,089 --> 01:17:47,089
I win.

943
01:17:47,549 --> 01:17:49,759
I win. I bested you in combat.

944
01:17:49,927 --> 01:17:51,847
No. I saved your life.

945
01:17:52,012 --> 01:17:53,842
Well, you were stupid enough
to let me live.

946
01:17:54,014 --> 01:17:55,014
You let me live!

947
01:17:55,182 --> 01:17:56,932
I don't need you always
trying to beat me!

948
01:17:57,100 --> 01:17:58,203
I'm not the one that just flew across

949
01:17:58,227 --> 01:17:59,867
the universe just
because I wanted to win.

950
01:17:59,895 --> 01:18:01,435
Do not tell me what I want.

951
01:18:01,605 --> 01:18:03,125
I don't need to tell you
what you want!

952
01:18:03,190 --> 01:18:04,200
It's obvious!

953
01:18:04,358 --> 01:18:07,448
You were the one who wanted to win.
And I just wanted a sister!

954
01:18:15,202 --> 01:18:16,742
You were all I had.

955
01:18:18,080 --> 01:18:20,920
But you were the one
who needed to win.

956
01:18:22,084 --> 01:18:24,294
Thanos pulled my eye from my head...

957
01:18:25,087 --> 01:18:27,087
and my brain from my skull...

958
01:18:28,257 --> 01:18:30,137
and my arm from my body...

959
01:18:31,927 --> 01:18:34,057
because of you.

960
01:18:54,908 --> 01:18:55,958
You all right, son?

961
01:18:59,288 --> 01:19:01,958
I saw your girl stomp off
a little earlier in quite a huff.

962
01:19:02,583 --> 01:19:03,913
Yeah.

963
01:19:04,084 --> 01:19:05,794
It's fortuitous...

964
01:19:05,961 --> 01:19:07,211
you listening to this song.

965
01:19:07,379 --> 01:19:09,009
- You know...
- Brandy?

966
01:19:09,506 --> 01:19:10,596
By Looking Glass?

967
01:19:12,342 --> 01:19:13,712
A favorite of your mom's.

968
01:19:14,595 --> 01:19:16,135
Yeah, it was.

969
01:19:16,555 --> 01:19:18,315
One of Earth's greatest
musical compositions.

970
01:19:18,390 --> 01:19:20,470
Perhaps its very greatest.

971
01:19:20,642 --> 01:19:21,642
Yes!

972
01:19:21,810 --> 01:19:24,980
Peter, you and I,
we're the sailor in that song.

973
01:19:27,191 --> 01:19:29,101
He came on a summer's day

974
01:19:29,443 --> 01:19:31,943
Bringing gifts from far away

975
01:19:33,989 --> 01:19:36,449
Like the child I put in your mother...

976
01:19:36,617 --> 01:19:38,667
or the freedom you brought Gamora.

977
01:19:40,746 --> 01:19:43,746
Brandy, you're a fine girl

978
01:19:43,916 --> 01:19:46,586
What a good wife you would be

979
01:19:47,669 --> 01:19:50,299
My life, my love

980
01:19:50,464 --> 01:19:53,754
My lady is the sea

981
01:19:53,926 --> 01:19:55,766
The sea calls the sailor back.

982
01:19:55,928 --> 01:19:58,518
He loves the girl,
but that's not his place.

983
01:19:59,264 --> 01:20:03,264
The sea calls upon him
as history calls upon great men.

984
01:20:04,436 --> 01:20:07,986
And sometimes we are deprived
the pleasures of mortals.

985
01:20:08,524 --> 01:20:10,654
Well, you may not be mortal, but me...

986
01:20:10,818 --> 01:20:11,948
No, Peter...

987
01:20:12,110 --> 01:20:14,110
death will remain a stranger
to both of us...

988
01:20:14,530 --> 01:20:16,700
as long as the light
burns within the planet.

989
01:20:17,658 --> 01:20:18,748
I'm immortal?

990
01:20:20,994 --> 01:20:21,994
Really?

991
01:20:22,162 --> 01:20:24,992
Yes! As long as the light exists.

992
01:20:26,041 --> 01:20:29,291
And I can use the light
to build cool things...

993
01:20:29,461 --> 01:20:31,751
like how you made this whole planet?

994
01:20:31,922 --> 01:20:34,292
It might take you
a few million years of practice...

995
01:20:34,466 --> 01:20:36,676
before you get really good at it.
But, yes!

996
01:20:36,844 --> 01:20:37,884
What!

997
01:20:38,178 --> 01:20:41,648
Get ready for an 800-foot statue
of Pac-Man with Skeletor...

998
01:20:41,807 --> 01:20:42,847
and Heather Locklear.

999
01:20:43,016 --> 01:20:44,176
You can do anything you want.

1000
01:20:44,309 --> 01:20:45,649
I'm gonna make some weird shit.

1001
01:20:45,811 --> 01:20:48,981
But you know, Peter,
it is a tremendous responsibility.

1002
01:20:49,148 --> 01:20:51,658
Only we can remake the universe.

1003
01:20:51,817 --> 01:20:54,277
Only we can take the bridle
of the cosmos...

1004
01:20:54,444 --> 01:20:57,284
and lead it to where it needs to go.

1005
01:20:58,448 --> 01:20:59,498
How?

1006
01:21:09,960 --> 01:21:11,470
Come with me.

1007
01:21:21,346 --> 01:21:22,976
Drax, Drax. Drax!

1008
01:21:23,348 --> 01:21:25,018
Drax! We need to talk.

1009
01:21:27,102 --> 01:21:28,932
I'm sorry.

1010
01:21:29,104 --> 01:21:31,274
But I like a woman
with some meat on her bones.

1011
01:21:31,440 --> 01:21:32,530
What?

1012
01:21:32,691 --> 01:21:35,941
I tried to let you down easily
by telling you I found you disgusting.

1013
01:21:36,111 --> 01:21:37,571
No, that's not what I...

1014
01:21:41,074 --> 01:21:42,494
What are you doing?

1015
01:21:43,076 --> 01:21:45,456
I'm imagining being with you physically.

1016
01:21:45,621 --> 01:21:46,911
Drax...

1017
01:21:47,456 --> 01:21:48,626
I don't like you like that.

1018
01:21:48,790 --> 01:21:50,750
I don't even like
the type of thing you are.

1019
01:21:51,251 --> 01:21:53,711
Hey! There's no need to get personal.

1020
01:21:53,879 --> 01:21:56,429
Listen! Ego's gotten exactly
what he wanted.

1021
01:21:56,590 --> 01:21:58,390
I should have told you earlier.

1022
01:21:58,550 --> 01:22:01,670
I'm stupid. You are in danger.

1023
01:22:07,392 --> 01:22:08,392
What is that?

1024
01:22:11,897 --> 01:22:15,447
Now, you need to readjust the way
you process life.

1025
01:22:15,609 --> 01:22:18,699
Everything around us,
including the girl...

1026
01:22:18,862 --> 01:22:22,322
Everything is temporary.

1027
01:22:22,491 --> 01:22:25,411
We are forever.

1028
01:22:25,577 --> 01:22:26,917
Doesn't eternity get boring?

1029
01:22:27,079 --> 01:22:29,499
Not if you have a purpose, Peter...

1030
01:22:29,665 --> 01:22:31,625
which is why you're here.

1031
01:22:31,792 --> 01:22:33,912
I told you how all those years ago...

1032
01:22:34,086 --> 01:22:38,216
I had an unceasing impulse to find life.

1033
01:22:38,382 --> 01:22:42,422
But what I did not tell you was how,
when I finally did find it...

1034
01:22:43,178 --> 01:22:44,478
it was all so...

1035
01:22:46,932 --> 01:22:48,762
disappointing.

1036
01:22:49,101 --> 01:22:52,601
And that is when I came...

1037
01:22:52,771 --> 01:22:56,481
to a profound realization.

1038
01:22:57,776 --> 01:23:01,906
My innate desire to seek out
other life...

1039
01:23:02,447 --> 01:23:06,617
was not so that I could
walk among that life.

1040
01:23:08,912 --> 01:23:10,082
Peter...

1041
01:23:11,039 --> 01:23:14,259
I have found meaning.

1042
01:23:34,146 --> 01:23:35,486
I see it.

1043
01:23:37,941 --> 01:23:39,771
Eternity!

1044
01:23:40,110 --> 01:23:41,610
Oh, my God.

1045
01:23:52,206 --> 01:23:54,296
We need to get off this planet.

1046
01:24:07,971 --> 01:24:09,261
Oh, man.

1047
01:24:09,431 --> 01:24:11,851
Anyway, before I was
so rudely interrupted...

1048
01:24:12,017 --> 01:24:14,897
At that time,
I was a Federal Express man.

1049
01:24:25,823 --> 01:24:27,863
What the hell you doing, boy?

1050
01:24:28,033 --> 01:24:30,113
I could tell
by how you talked about him...

1051
01:24:30,285 --> 01:24:31,615
this Ego is bad news.

1052
01:24:31,787 --> 01:24:33,417
We're here to save Quill.

1053
01:24:33,580 --> 01:24:37,620
For what? Huh?
For honor? For love?

1054
01:24:37,835 --> 01:24:40,715
No. I don't care about those things.

1055
01:24:40,879 --> 01:24:43,179
I wanna save Quill so I can prove
I'm better than him!

1056
01:24:43,340 --> 01:24:46,170
I can lord this over him forever.

1057
01:24:47,886 --> 01:24:49,766
What are you laughing at me for?

1058
01:24:50,347 --> 01:24:55,067
You can fool yourself and everyone
else, but you can't fool me.

1059
01:24:55,227 --> 01:24:56,437
I know who you are.

1060
01:24:56,603 --> 01:24:58,893
You don't know anything
about me, loser.

1061
01:24:59,064 --> 01:25:01,314
I know everything about you.

1062
01:25:01,817 --> 01:25:04,197
I know you play like
you're the meanest and the hardest...

1063
01:25:04,361 --> 01:25:05,964
but, actually,
you're the most scared of all.

1064
01:25:05,988 --> 01:25:06,828
Shut up!

1065
01:25:06,989 --> 01:25:09,289
I know you steal batteries
you don't need...

1066
01:25:09,449 --> 01:25:12,039
and you push away anyone
who's willing to put up with you...

1067
01:25:12,202 --> 01:25:13,638
because just a little bit of love...

1068
01:25:13,662 --> 01:25:16,992
reminds you how big and empty
that hole inside you actually is.

1069
01:25:17,332 --> 01:25:18,582
I said shut up!

1070
01:25:19,042 --> 01:25:22,122
I know them scientists what made you,
never gave a rat's ass about you.

1071
01:25:22,296 --> 01:25:23,586
I'm serious, dude!

1072
01:25:23,755 --> 01:25:26,345
Just like my own damn parents
who sold me...

1073
01:25:26,508 --> 01:25:28,518
their own little baby,
into slavery.

1074
01:25:29,011 --> 01:25:31,261
I know who you are, boy.

1075
01:25:31,430 --> 01:25:33,440
Because you're me.

1076
01:25:39,980 --> 01:25:42,060
What kind of a pair are we?

1077
01:25:43,358 --> 01:25:46,408
The kind that's about to go fight
a planet, I reckon.

1078
01:25:46,570 --> 01:25:49,740
All right, okay! Good. Wait.

1079
01:25:50,157 --> 01:25:51,577
Fight a what?

1080
01:25:55,954 --> 01:25:56,954
Who are you people?

1081
01:25:57,080 --> 01:25:58,080
What is this place?

1082
01:25:58,207 --> 01:25:59,207
Gamora, let her go!

1083
01:25:59,374 --> 01:26:01,544
The bodies in the caverns...
Who are they?

1084
01:26:01,710 --> 01:26:04,000
You are scared.

1085
01:26:07,424 --> 01:26:10,304
I call it the Expansion.

1086
01:26:11,428 --> 01:26:14,728
It is my purpose...

1087
01:26:14,890 --> 01:26:18,400
and now it is yours as well.

1088
01:26:19,269 --> 01:26:20,859
It's beautiful.

1089
01:26:21,980 --> 01:26:23,270
Over thousands of years...

1090
01:26:23,440 --> 01:26:27,560
I implanted thousands of extensions
of myself...

1091
01:26:27,736 --> 01:26:30,446
on thousands of worlds.

1092
01:26:30,614 --> 01:26:34,404
I need to fulfill life's
one true purpose...

1093
01:26:34,576 --> 01:26:36,456
To grow and spread...

1094
01:26:36,620 --> 01:26:39,750
covering all that exists...

1095
01:26:39,915 --> 01:26:44,085
until everything is...

1096
01:26:45,379 --> 01:26:46,379
Me!

1097
01:26:47,172 --> 01:26:49,422
What did she do to me?

1098
01:26:49,591 --> 01:26:51,301
She already told me everything.

1099
01:26:51,468 --> 01:26:53,928
I only had one problem.

1100
01:26:54,638 --> 01:26:59,688
A single Celestial doesn't have
enough power for such an enterprise.

1101
01:26:59,852 --> 01:27:01,972
But two Celestials...

1102
01:27:02,146 --> 01:27:05,446
Well, now, that just might do.

1103
01:27:08,193 --> 01:27:09,563
The bodies...

1104
01:27:10,320 --> 01:27:12,730
are his children.

1105
01:27:13,157 --> 01:27:14,447
Out of all my labors...

1106
01:27:14,616 --> 01:27:16,746
the most beguiling was...

1107
01:27:16,910 --> 01:27:20,330
attempting to graft my DNA
with that of another species.

1108
01:27:20,497 --> 01:27:23,417
I hoped the result of such a coupling
would be enough...

1109
01:27:23,584 --> 01:27:25,504
to power the Expansion.

1110
01:27:26,503 --> 01:27:29,003
I had Yondu deliver
some of them to me.

1111
01:27:29,173 --> 01:27:32,673
It broke the Ravager code, but
I compensated him generously...

1112
01:27:32,843 --> 01:27:36,423
and to ease his conscience,
I said I'd never hurt them.

1113
01:27:36,597 --> 01:27:39,227
I mean, that was true.
They never felt a thing.

1114
01:27:39,391 --> 01:27:42,681
But one after the other, they failed me.

1115
01:27:42,853 --> 01:27:46,693
Not one of them carried
the Celestial genes.

1116
01:27:46,857 --> 01:27:48,107
Until you, Peter.

1117
01:27:49,318 --> 01:27:51,908
Out of all my spawn...

1118
01:27:52,070 --> 01:27:56,150
only you carried the connection
to the light.

1119
01:27:56,325 --> 01:27:59,205
We need to find Peter now,
and get off this damn planet.

1120
01:27:59,369 --> 01:28:01,959
Ego will have won him
to his side by now.

1121
01:28:03,165 --> 01:28:04,545
- Then we just go.
- No!

1122
01:28:04,708 --> 01:28:06,968
- He's our friend.
- All any of you do...

1123
01:28:07,127 --> 01:28:09,297
is yell at each other.
You are not friends.

1124
01:28:09,463 --> 01:28:10,833
You're right.

1125
01:28:11,381 --> 01:28:12,501
We're family.

1126
01:28:14,343 --> 01:28:15,963
We leave no one behind.

1127
01:28:19,348 --> 01:28:20,728
Except maybe you.

1128
01:28:21,225 --> 01:28:22,725
Oh, my God.

1129
01:28:23,393 --> 01:28:25,473
For the first time in my existence...

1130
01:28:25,646 --> 01:28:28,696
I am truly not alone!

1131
01:28:34,112 --> 01:28:35,402
What is it, son?

1132
01:28:38,659 --> 01:28:39,909
My friends.

1133
01:28:41,161 --> 01:28:45,201
You see,
that's the mortal in you, Peter.

1134
01:28:45,749 --> 01:28:46,749
Yes.

1135
01:28:46,792 --> 01:28:49,872
We are beyond such things.

1136
01:28:50,045 --> 01:28:51,045
Yes.

1137
01:28:53,465 --> 01:28:54,675
- Now...
- But my mother...

1138
01:28:57,553 --> 01:28:59,883
You said you loved my mother.

1139
01:29:00,055 --> 01:29:01,555
And that I did.

1140
01:29:02,808 --> 01:29:07,688
My river lily who knew all the words
to every song that came over the radio.

1141
01:29:09,481 --> 01:29:12,151
I returned to Earth
to see her three times.

1142
01:29:12,317 --> 01:29:14,867
And I knew if I returned a fourth...

1143
01:29:15,028 --> 01:29:16,578
I'd never leave.

1144
01:29:17,698 --> 01:29:19,248
The Expansion...

1145
01:29:20,659 --> 01:29:22,999
the reason for my very existence,
would be over.

1146
01:29:23,162 --> 01:29:25,202
So, I did what I had to do.

1147
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:31,510
But it broke my heart
to put that tumor in her head.

1148
01:29:36,008 --> 01:29:36,848
What?

1149
01:29:37,009 --> 01:29:38,559
Now, all right...

1150
01:29:38,719 --> 01:29:40,479
I know that sounds bad.

1151
01:29:52,399 --> 01:29:55,869
Who in the hell do you think you are?

1152
01:29:56,028 --> 01:29:57,658
You killed my mother!

1153
01:29:57,821 --> 01:29:58,861
I tried...

1154
01:29:59,031 --> 01:30:00,781
so hard...

1155
01:30:00,949 --> 01:30:02,329
to find the form...

1156
01:30:02,493 --> 01:30:04,863
that best suited you...

1157
01:30:05,037 --> 01:30:07,457
and this is the thanks I get?

1158
01:30:09,166 --> 01:30:11,716
You really need to grow up.

1159
01:30:15,797 --> 01:30:18,047
I wanted to do this together...

1160
01:30:18,217 --> 01:30:21,017
but I suppose you'll have
to learn by spending

1161
01:30:21,136 --> 01:30:23,596
the next thousand years as a battery!

1162
01:30:25,307 --> 01:30:27,107
Finally! Rocket?

1163
01:30:27,267 --> 01:30:29,977
Keep that transmitter nearby,
so I can find you.

1164
01:30:30,145 --> 01:30:33,315
We're in an old piece of construction
equipment Yondu once used...

1165
01:30:33,482 --> 01:30:34,918
to slice open the Bank of A'askavaria.

1166
01:30:34,942 --> 01:30:35,942
Ego's unhinged.

1167
01:30:35,984 --> 01:30:37,404
I know. Get ready.

1168
01:30:37,569 --> 01:30:38,989
Drop her, Kraglin.

1169
01:30:57,589 --> 01:30:58,719
No.

1170
01:31:09,810 --> 01:31:12,690
My life, my love

1171
01:31:12,855 --> 01:31:15,065
My lady is the sea

1172
01:31:17,151 --> 01:31:18,271
Peter...

1173
01:31:19,069 --> 01:31:21,409
this is the sea.

1174
01:32:04,573 --> 01:32:06,243
Hey, there, jackass!

1175
01:32:16,502 --> 01:32:18,002
What is that thing?

1176
01:32:25,511 --> 01:32:27,471
Out of the way, dumber, smaller Groot!

1177
01:32:32,226 --> 01:32:34,896
I told you something didn't feel right.

1178
01:32:35,062 --> 01:32:37,352
"I told you so."
Just what I need to hear right now.

1179
01:32:37,523 --> 01:32:39,193
Well, I came back, didn't I?

1180
01:32:39,858 --> 01:32:41,218
Because there's an unspoken thing.

1181
01:32:41,318 --> 01:32:43,368
There is no unspoken thing.

1182
01:32:43,529 --> 01:32:45,369
What are you doing?
You could've killed us all!

1183
01:32:45,906 --> 01:32:47,446
"Thank you, Rocket"?

1184
01:32:47,616 --> 01:32:48,786
We had it under control.

1185
01:32:48,951 --> 01:32:51,281
We did not.
That is only an extension...

1186
01:32:51,453 --> 01:32:53,583
of his true self.
He will be back soon.

1187
01:32:53,747 --> 01:32:54,997
What's Smurfette doing here?

1188
01:32:55,165 --> 01:32:57,005
Whatever I need to do to get
a damn ride home.

1189
01:32:57,167 --> 01:32:58,417
She tried to murder me!

1190
01:32:58,585 --> 01:33:00,425
I saved you, you stupid fox!

1191
01:33:00,587 --> 01:33:02,007
He's not a fox.

1192
01:33:02,172 --> 01:33:04,212
- I am Groot.
- I'm not a raboon, either.

1193
01:33:04,383 --> 01:33:05,383
I am Groot.

1194
01:33:05,551 --> 01:33:07,091
"Raccoon." Whatever.

1195
01:33:10,514 --> 01:33:11,844
How do we kill a Celestial?

1196
01:33:12,015 --> 01:33:13,435
There's a center to him.

1197
01:33:13,600 --> 01:33:17,100
His brain, his soul, whatever it is...
Some sort of protective shell.

1198
01:33:17,437 --> 01:33:18,487
It's in the caverns...

1199
01:33:18,647 --> 01:33:19,737
below the surface.

1200
01:33:22,317 --> 01:33:23,617
Yondu?

1201
01:33:32,536 --> 01:33:33,786
Thrusters are out.

1202
01:33:34,288 --> 01:33:36,038
Guess I should be glad
I was a skinny kid.

1203
01:33:36,206 --> 01:33:38,166
Otherwise, you'd have delivered me
to this maniac.

1204
01:33:38,208 --> 01:33:40,728
You still reckon that's the reason
I kept you around, you idiot?

1205
01:33:40,794 --> 01:33:42,354
That's what you told me,
you old doofus.

1206
01:33:42,921 --> 01:33:45,041
Once I figured out
what happened to them other kids...

1207
01:33:45,174 --> 01:33:46,754
I wasn't just gonna hand you over.

1208
01:33:46,925 --> 01:33:48,465
You said you were gonna eat me.

1209
01:33:48,635 --> 01:33:50,175
That was being funny!

1210
01:33:50,971 --> 01:33:52,131
Not to me!

1211
01:33:52,306 --> 01:33:53,476
You people have issues.

1212
01:33:53,640 --> 01:33:55,510
Of course I have issues.

1213
01:33:56,351 --> 01:33:59,181
That's my freakin' father!

1214
01:33:59,354 --> 01:34:00,934
Thrusters are back up.

1215
01:34:14,536 --> 01:34:16,706
- We should be going up!
- We can't!

1216
01:34:16,872 --> 01:34:19,452
Ego wants to eradicate the universe
as we know it.

1217
01:34:19,625 --> 01:34:20,915
We have to kill him.

1218
01:34:21,084 --> 01:34:21,754
Rocket!

1219
01:34:21,919 --> 01:34:22,919
Got it!

1220
01:34:36,809 --> 01:34:38,649
So, we're saving the galaxy again?

1221
01:34:38,811 --> 01:34:39,891
I guess.

1222
01:34:40,062 --> 01:34:41,142
Awesome!

1223
01:34:43,148 --> 01:34:45,358
We're really gonna be able to
jack up our prices...

1224
01:34:45,526 --> 01:34:47,116
if we're two-time galaxy savers.

1225
01:34:47,277 --> 01:34:49,867
I seriously can't believe
that's where your mind goes.

1226
01:34:50,030 --> 01:34:52,780
It was just a random thought, man.
I thought we were friends.

1227
01:34:52,950 --> 01:34:55,250
Of course, I care about the planets,
and the buildings...

1228
01:34:55,410 --> 01:34:57,240
and all the animals on the planets.

1229
01:34:57,412 --> 01:34:58,622
And the people.

1230
01:34:58,789 --> 01:34:59,789
Meh.

1231
01:35:00,415 --> 01:35:04,585
The crabby puppy is so cute.
He makes me wanna die!

1232
01:35:42,291 --> 01:35:43,291
Pilots...

1233
01:35:43,458 --> 01:35:44,798
release envoy units.

1234
01:35:46,962 --> 01:35:51,042
Our sensors detect the batteries
are below the surface of the planet.

1235
01:35:52,885 --> 01:35:53,885
Dive!

1236
01:36:10,861 --> 01:36:12,361
Captain?

1237
01:36:13,113 --> 01:36:14,533
Captain?

1238
01:36:19,495 --> 01:36:21,245
Tell me why Ego wants you here?

1239
01:36:21,705 --> 01:36:23,505
He needs my genetic connection
to the light...

1240
01:36:23,582 --> 01:36:25,702
to help destroy the universe.

1241
01:36:25,876 --> 01:36:28,126
He tried to teach me
how to control the power.

1242
01:36:28,295 --> 01:36:29,425
So, could you?

1243
01:36:29,588 --> 01:36:30,758
A little.

1244
01:36:30,923 --> 01:36:32,093
I made a ball.

1245
01:36:32,257 --> 01:36:33,307
A ball?

1246
01:36:33,467 --> 01:36:36,847
I thought as hard as I could.
It was all that I could come up with.

1247
01:36:37,012 --> 01:36:38,262
You "thought"?

1248
01:36:38,430 --> 01:36:40,470
You think when I make this arrow fly...

1249
01:36:40,641 --> 01:36:42,051
I use my head?

1250
01:36:54,029 --> 01:36:55,329
Whoa.

1251
01:37:04,164 --> 01:37:05,164
There.

1252
01:37:05,332 --> 01:37:07,292
That's Ego's core.

1253
01:37:09,670 --> 01:37:11,300
That ore is thick, Rocket.

1254
01:37:11,463 --> 01:37:13,083
I got it covered.

1255
01:37:19,471 --> 01:37:20,801
We must hurry.

1256
01:37:20,973 --> 01:37:23,093
It will not take Ego long to find us.

1257
01:37:27,312 --> 01:37:28,522
Keep it steady.

1258
01:37:35,028 --> 01:37:37,118
We drill into the center, we kill him!

1259
01:37:43,495 --> 01:37:44,825
Captain?

1260
01:37:45,164 --> 01:37:46,164
What is it, Kraglin?

1261
01:37:46,331 --> 01:37:48,371
Hey, remember that Ayesha chick?

1262
01:37:48,834 --> 01:37:50,004
Yeah, why?

1263
01:37:51,003 --> 01:37:52,043
Oh, hell!

1264
01:38:12,816 --> 01:38:14,526
Why aren't you firing the lasers?

1265
01:38:14,902 --> 01:38:16,612
They blew out the generator.

1266
01:38:16,778 --> 01:38:19,538
I think I packed a small detonator.

1267
01:38:19,698 --> 01:38:21,418
A detonator is worthless
without explosives.

1268
01:38:21,450 --> 01:38:23,040
Well, we got these.

1269
01:38:23,702 --> 01:38:25,702
Is that thing strong enough to kill Ego?

1270
01:38:25,871 --> 01:38:27,781
If it is,
it'll cause a chain reaction...

1271
01:38:27,956 --> 01:38:29,626
throughout his entire nervous system.

1272
01:38:29,791 --> 01:38:30,541
Meaning what?

1273
01:38:30,709 --> 01:38:32,339
The entire planet will explode.

1274
01:38:32,503 --> 01:38:34,003
We'll have to get out of here fast.

1275
01:38:34,171 --> 01:38:35,671
I rigged a timer.

1276
01:38:36,632 --> 01:38:37,842
Go!

1277
01:38:51,939 --> 01:38:53,739
He's coming.

1278
01:38:55,150 --> 01:38:56,940
Didn't you say you
could make him sleep?

1279
01:38:57,319 --> 01:38:59,739
When he wants. He's too powerful.

1280
01:38:59,905 --> 01:39:01,325
I can't!

1281
01:39:01,740 --> 01:39:03,610
You don't have to believe in yourself...

1282
01:39:04,326 --> 01:39:06,456
because I believe in you.

1283
01:39:18,757 --> 01:39:19,757
Sleep!

1284
01:39:27,141 --> 01:39:28,741
I never thought
she'd be able to do it...

1285
01:39:28,892 --> 01:39:31,142
with as weak and skinny
as she appears to be.

1286
01:39:32,062 --> 01:39:35,142
I don't know how long I can hold him.

1287
01:39:38,277 --> 01:39:39,947
The metal's too thick.

1288
01:39:40,112 --> 01:39:43,442
For the bomb to work, we'd actually
need to place it on Ego's core.

1289
01:39:43,615 --> 01:39:45,995
And our fat butts ain't gonna fit
through those tiny holes.

1290
01:39:46,702 --> 01:39:47,702
Well...

1291
01:39:50,289 --> 01:39:52,169
That's a terrible idea.

1292
01:39:52,332 --> 01:39:54,702
Which is the only kind of idea
we have left.

1293
01:39:55,669 --> 01:39:57,089
Unbelievable.

1294
01:39:57,254 --> 01:39:59,584
"Rocket, do this.
Rocket, do that."

1295
01:40:01,091 --> 01:40:02,551
What a day.

1296
01:40:10,142 --> 01:40:13,682
All right, first you flick this switch,
then this switch.

1297
01:40:13,854 --> 01:40:15,064
That activates it.

1298
01:40:15,230 --> 01:40:17,060
Then you push this button...

1299
01:40:17,232 --> 01:40:20,272
which will give you five minutes
to get out of there.

1300
01:40:20,444 --> 01:40:21,824
Now, whatever you do...

1301
01:40:22,362 --> 01:40:24,782
don't push this button...

1302
01:40:24,948 --> 01:40:28,538
because that will set off the bomb
immediately and we'll all be dead.

1303
01:40:28,702 --> 01:40:31,122
Now, repeat back what I just said.

1304
01:40:31,288 --> 01:40:33,088
- I am Groot.
- Uh-huh.

1305
01:40:33,248 --> 01:40:35,208
- I am Groot.
- That's right.

1306
01:40:35,375 --> 01:40:36,585
- I am Groot.
- No!

1307
01:40:36,919 --> 01:40:39,299
No, that's the button
that will kill everyone!

1308
01:40:39,463 --> 01:40:40,463
Try again.

1309
01:40:43,467 --> 01:40:45,307
- I am Groot.
- Mm-hmm.

1310
01:40:45,469 --> 01:40:47,519
- I am Groot.
- Uh-huh.

1311
01:40:47,679 --> 01:40:48,679
I am Groot.

1312
01:40:48,764 --> 01:40:50,594
No! That's exactly what you just said!

1313
01:40:50,766 --> 01:40:52,356
How is that even possible?

1314
01:40:52,518 --> 01:40:54,728
Which button is the button
you're supposed to push?

1315
01:40:54,895 --> 01:40:56,025
Point to it.

1316
01:40:56,188 --> 01:40:57,188
No!

1317
01:40:57,481 --> 01:40:59,231
Hey, you're making him nervous!

1318
01:40:59,399 --> 01:41:01,159
Shut up and get me some tape!

1319
01:41:01,318 --> 01:41:02,798
Does anybody have any tape out there?

1320
01:41:02,861 --> 01:41:04,581
I wanna put some tape
over the death button.

1321
01:41:04,738 --> 01:41:07,618
I don't have any tape. Let me check.

1322
01:41:07,783 --> 01:41:09,243
Yo, Yondu...

1323
01:41:10,619 --> 01:41:12,789
Do you have any tape?

1324
01:41:15,082 --> 01:41:18,122
Gamora? Do you have any tape?

1325
01:41:18,293 --> 01:41:19,333
Tape!

1326
01:41:19,503 --> 01:41:20,753
Never mind.

1327
01:41:22,840 --> 01:41:25,430
Drax, do you have any tape?

1328
01:41:26,176 --> 01:41:28,136
Yes, Scotch tape would work.

1329
01:41:28,428 --> 01:41:30,388
Then why did you ask me
if Scotch tape would work,

1330
01:41:30,472 --> 01:41:31,972
if you don't have any?

1331
01:41:32,975 --> 01:41:34,105
Nobody has any tape!

1332
01:41:34,268 --> 01:41:35,818
Not a single person has tape?

1333
01:41:36,186 --> 01:41:37,186
Nope!

1334
01:41:37,354 --> 01:41:38,524
Did you ask Nebula?

1335
01:41:39,398 --> 01:41:40,108
Yes!

1336
01:41:40,274 --> 01:41:41,484
Are you sure?

1337
01:41:41,650 --> 01:41:42,940
I asked Yondu...

1338
01:41:43,110 --> 01:41:45,421
- and she was sitting next to him.
- I knew you were lying!

1339
01:41:45,445 --> 01:41:47,632
You have priceless batteries
and an atomic bomb in your bag.

1340
01:41:47,656 --> 01:41:50,036
If anybody's gonna have tape, it's you!

1341
01:41:50,200 --> 01:41:53,700
That's exactly my point!
I have to do everything!

1342
01:41:53,912 --> 01:41:56,412
You are wasting a lot of time here!

1343
01:42:02,754 --> 01:42:04,754
We're all gonna die.

1344
01:42:06,425 --> 01:42:08,595
Rear thrusters are out again!

1345
01:42:08,760 --> 01:42:11,550
We're done for without that generator!

1346
01:42:24,818 --> 01:42:26,068
Guardians...

1347
01:42:26,862 --> 01:42:28,532
perhaps it will provide you solace...

1348
01:42:28,697 --> 01:42:31,367
that your deaths
are not without purpose.

1349
01:42:31,867 --> 01:42:33,537
They will serve as a warning...

1350
01:42:33,702 --> 01:42:35,952
to all of those tempted
with betraying us.

1351
01:42:36,497 --> 01:42:39,297
Don't screw with the Sovereign.

1352
01:42:43,045 --> 01:42:44,125
This is gonna hurt.

1353
01:42:44,296 --> 01:42:45,926
Promises, promises.

1354
01:42:56,266 --> 01:42:57,266
Hey!

1355
01:43:08,904 --> 01:43:09,904
No!

1356
01:43:10,489 --> 01:43:12,619
No! No! No!

1357
01:43:18,080 --> 01:43:19,090
We're gonna blow!

1358
01:43:24,336 --> 01:43:26,376
Peter! No!

1359
01:43:46,191 --> 01:43:47,191
What?

1360
01:43:47,526 --> 01:43:49,526
You look like Mary Poppins.

1361
01:43:49,695 --> 01:43:51,115
Is he cool?

1362
01:43:52,906 --> 01:43:54,616
Hell, yeah, he's cool.

1363
01:43:55,284 --> 01:43:57,244
I'm Mary Poppins, y'all!

1364
01:44:24,563 --> 01:44:26,643
Mantis, look out!

1365
01:44:38,702 --> 01:44:40,372
She's just unconscious.

1366
01:44:56,345 --> 01:44:57,885
How long until the bomb goes off?

1367
01:44:58,055 --> 01:45:00,395
In the unlikely event
that Groot doesn't kill us all...

1368
01:45:00,557 --> 01:45:01,807
about six minutes.

1369
01:45:06,772 --> 01:45:09,272
Kraglin, we need the quadrant
for an extraction.

1370
01:45:09,441 --> 01:45:10,441
T-minus five minutes.

1371
01:45:10,609 --> 01:45:11,779
Aye, Captain.

1372
01:45:15,614 --> 01:45:17,534
Somebody's gotta be up top
when Kraglin arrives.

1373
01:45:18,826 --> 01:45:20,366
Drax, take Mantis.

1374
01:45:23,205 --> 01:45:24,585
My nipples!

1375
01:45:32,714 --> 01:45:34,044
Gamora!

1376
01:45:37,678 --> 01:45:38,808
Peter!

1377
01:46:05,038 --> 01:46:06,458
Get over it.

1378
01:46:06,832 --> 01:46:10,712
Come now, Peter.
I know this isn't what you want.

1379
01:46:12,713 --> 01:46:17,213
What kind of father would I be
to let you make this choice?

1380
01:46:46,663 --> 01:46:47,783
Yeah!

1381
01:46:48,749 --> 01:46:52,379
Soon, Peter, we will be all there is.

1382
01:46:53,045 --> 01:46:56,255
So stop pissing me off!

1383
01:47:16,360 --> 01:47:18,000
We have to get up
to the extraction point!

1384
01:47:26,078 --> 01:47:27,078
Go!

1385
01:49:26,532 --> 01:49:28,112
I told you...

1386
01:49:28,283 --> 01:49:32,203
I don't want to do this alone.

1387
01:49:35,415 --> 01:49:36,415
You cannot deny...

1388
01:49:36,583 --> 01:49:40,923
the purpose the universe
has bestowed upon you.

1389
01:49:50,013 --> 01:49:51,803
Everyone, I need you to stay back!

1390
01:49:52,015 --> 01:49:53,015
What is that?

1391
01:50:08,699 --> 01:50:10,999
It doesn't need to be like this, Peter.

1392
01:50:13,036 --> 01:50:16,166
Why are you destroying our chance?

1393
01:50:18,792 --> 01:50:21,922
Stop pretending you
aren't what you are.

1394
01:50:23,839 --> 01:50:24,839
One in billions.

1395
01:50:26,550 --> 01:50:28,390
Trillions. Even more.

1396
01:50:30,721 --> 01:50:35,101
What greater meaning
can life possibly have to offer?

1397
01:50:37,769 --> 01:50:41,949
I don't use my head
to fly the arrow, boy!

1398
01:50:42,441 --> 01:50:44,311
I use my heart...

1399
01:51:19,561 --> 01:51:23,351
You shouldn't have killed my mom,
and squished my Walkman.

1400
01:51:23,524 --> 01:51:27,064
And if you don't love me now

1401
01:51:27,236 --> 01:51:29,656
You will never love me again

1402
01:51:29,822 --> 01:51:32,652
I can still hear you saying

1403
01:51:32,825 --> 01:51:36,745
You would never break the chain

1404
01:51:36,912 --> 01:51:38,952
And if you don't love me now

1405
01:51:39,122 --> 01:51:41,792
You will never love me again

1406
01:51:42,417 --> 01:51:46,587
I can still hear you saying

1407
01:51:46,755 --> 01:51:49,545
You would never break the chain

1408
01:51:49,716 --> 01:51:52,266
And if you don't love me now

1409
01:51:52,427 --> 01:51:55,307
You will never love me again

1410
01:51:55,472 --> 01:51:58,000
I can still hear you saying

1411
01:51:58,030 --> 01:52:00,932
You would never break the chain

1412
01:52:03,605 --> 01:52:06,395
Groot? If you can hear me,
hurry up!

1413
01:52:06,567 --> 01:52:09,817
I'm not sure how long Quill
can keep him distracted!

1414
01:52:10,195 --> 01:52:11,785
Groot, hurry!

1415
01:53:07,544 --> 01:53:09,794
Yondu, we're about to blow!

1416
01:53:09,963 --> 01:53:11,423
Get to the ship!

1417
01:53:11,590 --> 01:53:12,640
Not without Quill!

1418
01:53:12,800 --> 01:53:14,970
You need to take care of the twig!

1419
01:53:16,220 --> 01:53:18,020
Not without you!

1420
01:53:19,181 --> 01:53:22,471
I ain't done nothin' right
my whole damn life, rat.

1421
01:53:25,854 --> 01:53:28,064
You need to give me this.

1422
01:53:38,283 --> 01:53:40,783
A spacesuit and an aero-rig.

1423
01:53:40,953 --> 01:53:43,123
I only have one of each.

1424
01:53:55,384 --> 01:53:57,054
I am Groot.

1425
01:53:57,803 --> 01:53:58,883
What's that?

1426
01:54:00,514 --> 01:54:04,724
He says, "Welcome to the frickin'
Guardians of the Galaxy."

1427
01:54:05,310 --> 01:54:07,680
Only he didn't use "frickin'."

1428
01:54:13,944 --> 01:54:15,024
Bye, twig.

1429
01:54:16,947 --> 01:54:20,577
We're gonna need to have a real
discussion about your language.

1430
01:55:15,214 --> 01:55:16,214
Where's Peter?

1431
01:55:16,965 --> 01:55:18,965
Rocket, where is he?

1432
01:55:19,718 --> 01:55:20,718
Rocket.

1433
01:55:20,844 --> 01:55:22,424
Rocket, look at me! Where is he?

1434
01:55:28,811 --> 01:55:31,181
No. I'm not leaving without him.

1435
01:55:38,153 --> 01:55:39,153
I'm sorry.

1436
01:55:39,988 --> 01:55:42,828
I can only afford to lose one
friend today.

1437
01:55:43,367 --> 01:55:44,367
Kraglin, go!

1438
01:55:45,202 --> 01:55:46,202
Wait...

1439
01:55:46,954 --> 01:55:48,534
Is Quill back?

1440
01:55:50,040 --> 01:55:52,580
Rocket, where's Quill?

1441
01:55:53,627 --> 01:55:57,047
Rocket, where's Quill?

1442
01:55:58,048 --> 01:55:59,298
Rocket!

1443
01:56:00,384 --> 01:56:01,384
Where's Quill?

1444
01:56:03,387 --> 01:56:05,387
Where's Quill?

1445
01:56:13,605 --> 01:56:15,855
No, we need to stop it.

1446
01:56:21,029 --> 01:56:22,039
Stop.

1447
01:56:22,823 --> 01:56:24,443
Stop. Listen to me!

1448
01:56:24,616 --> 01:56:26,206
You are a god.

1449
01:56:27,619 --> 01:56:28,959
If you kill me...

1450
01:56:29,121 --> 01:56:31,741
you'll be just like everybody else.

1451
01:56:32,791 --> 01:56:34,411
What's so wrong with that?

1452
01:56:34,585 --> 01:56:35,585
No!

1453
01:57:26,220 --> 01:57:29,980
He may have been your father, boy,
but he wasn't your daddy.

1454
01:57:34,311 --> 01:57:36,641
I'm sorry I didn't do none of it right.

1455
01:57:37,731 --> 01:57:40,021
I'm damn lucky you're my boy.

1456
01:57:43,779 --> 01:57:45,119
What?

1457
01:57:56,875 --> 01:57:58,045
Yondu, what are you doing?

1458
01:57:58,210 --> 01:57:59,380
You can't.

1459
01:58:00,087 --> 01:58:01,837
Yondu!

1460
01:58:07,427 --> 01:58:09,017
No!

1461
01:58:13,600 --> 01:58:14,600
No!

1462
01:58:17,855 --> 01:58:20,445
No! No!

1463
01:58:21,733 --> 01:58:23,023
No!

1464
01:59:17,831 --> 01:59:19,241
I told Gamora...

1465
01:59:19,416 --> 01:59:23,336
how when I was a kid I used to
pretend David Hasselhoff was my dad.

1466
01:59:26,089 --> 01:59:28,809
He's a singer and actor from Earth,
really famous guy.

1467
01:59:30,302 --> 01:59:32,222
Earlier, it struck me...

1468
01:59:33,430 --> 01:59:37,550
Yondu didn't have a talking car,
but he did have a flying arrow.

1469
01:59:38,143 --> 01:59:40,273
He didn't have the beautiful voice
of an angel...

1470
01:59:40,437 --> 01:59:42,737
but he did have the whistle of one.

1471
01:59:42,898 --> 01:59:46,408
Both Yondu and David Hasselhoff
went on kick-ass adventures...

1472
01:59:46,568 --> 01:59:49,078
and hooked up with hot women...

1473
01:59:49,238 --> 01:59:51,238
and fought robots.

1474
01:59:53,909 --> 01:59:57,919
I guess David Hasselhoff did kind
of end up being my dad after all.

1475
01:59:58,080 --> 01:59:59,250
Only it was you, Yondu.

1476
02:00:05,838 --> 02:00:07,758
I had a pretty cool dad.

1477
02:00:10,759 --> 02:00:13,429
What I'm trying to say here is...

1478
02:00:14,429 --> 02:00:19,109
sometimes that thing you're searching
for your whole life...

1479
02:00:21,436 --> 02:00:23,776
it's right there by your side all along.

1480
02:00:23,939 --> 02:00:25,779
You don't even know it.

1481
02:00:37,828 --> 02:00:39,288
I am Groot.

1482
02:00:40,664 --> 02:00:42,454
He did call you twig.

1483
02:00:44,835 --> 02:00:46,165
Nebula...

1484
02:00:51,133 --> 02:00:53,133
I was a child like you.

1485
02:00:53,969 --> 02:00:58,139
I was concerned with staying alive
until the next day, every day.

1486
02:00:58,307 --> 02:01:01,267
And I never considered
what Thanos was doing to you.

1487
02:01:01,435 --> 02:01:03,185
I'm trying to make it right.

1488
02:01:03,353 --> 02:01:04,773
There are little girls like you...

1489
02:01:04,938 --> 02:01:07,778
across the universe who are in danger.

1490
02:01:10,444 --> 02:01:11,984
You can stay with us and help them.

1491
02:01:12,613 --> 02:01:14,993
I will help them by killing Thanos.

1492
02:01:15,157 --> 02:01:17,157
I don't know if that's possible.

1493
02:01:32,049 --> 02:01:34,179
You will always be my sister.

1494
02:02:18,554 --> 02:02:19,554
Pete!

1495
02:02:23,183 --> 02:02:24,933
Captain found this for you
in a junker shop.

1496
02:02:25,102 --> 02:02:27,932
Said you'd come back
to the fold someday.

1497
02:02:29,731 --> 02:02:30,891
What is it?

1498
02:02:31,066 --> 02:02:32,066
It's called a Zune.

1499
02:02:32,192 --> 02:02:34,045
It's what everybody's listening
to on Earth nowadays.

1500
02:02:34,069 --> 02:02:35,619
It's got 300 songs on it.

1501
02:02:35,779 --> 02:02:38,079
300 songs?

1502
02:02:43,203 --> 02:02:44,373
Wait.

1503
02:02:50,419 --> 02:02:52,299
Rocket grabbed the pieces,
and reassembled them.

1504
02:02:52,421 --> 02:02:54,881
I think Yondu would want you to have it.

1505
02:02:58,302 --> 02:02:59,632
Thanks...

1506
02:03:01,472 --> 02:03:02,762
Captain.

1507
02:03:41,804 --> 02:03:44,594
It's not time to make a change

1508
02:03:45,641 --> 02:03:49,261
Just relax, take it easy

1509
02:03:49,436 --> 02:03:53,146
You're still young, that's your fault

1510
02:03:53,315 --> 02:03:56,275
There's so much you have to know

1511
02:03:56,443 --> 02:04:00,613
Find a girl, settle down

1512
02:04:00,781 --> 02:04:03,901
If you want you can marry

1513
02:04:04,076 --> 02:04:09,496
Look at me, I am old, but I'm happy

1514
02:04:14,837 --> 02:04:16,177
They came.

1515
02:04:24,179 --> 02:04:25,639
What is it?

1516
02:04:26,306 --> 02:04:28,861
I sent word to Yondu's
old Ravager buddies,

1517
02:04:28,891 --> 02:04:30,436
and told them what he did.

1518
02:04:34,022 --> 02:04:35,852
It's a Ravager funeral.

1519
02:04:53,292 --> 02:04:54,292
Yeah!

1520
02:04:54,877 --> 02:04:56,337
Yeah!

1521
02:05:03,677 --> 02:05:05,557
He didn't let us down
after all, Captain.

1522
02:05:06,513 --> 02:05:08,303
No, he did not, son.

1523
02:05:09,308 --> 02:05:10,728
He did not.

1524
02:05:17,399 --> 02:05:20,819
Fare thee well, old friend.

1525
02:05:23,030 --> 02:05:27,870
Yondu Udonta, I will see you
in the stars.

1526
02:05:31,914 --> 02:05:33,914
He didn't chase them away.

1527
02:05:34,082 --> 02:05:35,162
No.

1528
02:05:36,210 --> 02:05:38,340
Even though he yelled at them.

1529
02:05:38,504 --> 02:05:40,004
And was always mean.

1530
02:05:42,591 --> 02:05:44,711
And he stole batteries he didn't need.

1531
02:05:50,349 --> 02:05:51,899
Well, of course not.

1532
02:06:16,124 --> 02:06:17,294
What?

1533
02:06:17,960 --> 02:06:19,090
It's just...

1534
02:06:21,755 --> 02:06:24,465
some unspoken thing.

1535
02:06:33,559 --> 02:06:35,649
It's beautiful.

1536
02:06:37,146 --> 02:06:38,316
It is.

1537
02:06:39,815 --> 02:06:41,985
And so are you.

1538
02:06:43,944 --> 02:06:45,154
On the inside.

1539
02:06:51,994 --> 02:06:53,824
Now there's a way

1540
02:06:53,996 --> 02:06:57,996
And I know that I have to go away

1541
02:06:59,668 --> 02:07:02,178
I know I have to go

1542
02:08:41,270 --> 02:08:42,360
You know, it's a shame...

1543
02:08:42,521 --> 02:08:46,901
that it took the tragedy of losing Yondu
to bring us all together again.

1544
02:08:47,067 --> 02:08:50,277
But I think he'd be proud knowing
that we are back as a team.

1545
02:08:50,946 --> 02:08:51,946
I'm in.

1546
02:08:52,114 --> 02:08:53,114
Dope.

1547
02:08:53,240 --> 02:08:55,290
I miss you guys so much!

1548
02:08:55,450 --> 02:08:56,700
Hell, yes.

1549
02:08:59,746 --> 02:09:01,746
What say we steal some shit?

1550
02:11:20,846 --> 02:11:22,766
High Priestess, the Council is waiting.

1551
02:11:24,016 --> 02:11:27,106
They are perturbed
I've wasted our resources.

1552
02:11:31,773 --> 02:11:34,733
When they see
what I have created here...

1553
02:11:34,902 --> 02:11:36,942
their wrath will dissipate.

1554
02:11:38,113 --> 02:11:41,113
It's a new type of birthing pod, ma'am?

1555
02:11:42,534 --> 02:11:43,744
That, my child...

1556
02:11:43,911 --> 02:11:45,871
is the next step in our evolution.

1557
02:11:46,038 --> 02:11:49,088
More powerful, more beautiful...

1558
02:11:49,249 --> 02:11:53,429
more capable of destroying
the Guardians of the Galaxy.

1559
02:11:55,964 --> 02:11:58,554
I think I shall call him...

1560
02:12:00,302 --> 02:12:01,802
Adam.

1561
02:14:04,343 --> 02:14:05,343
Dude.

1562
02:14:06,053 --> 02:14:07,593
Seriously?

1563
02:14:07,763 --> 02:14:08,906
You gotta clean up your room.

1564
02:14:08,936 --> 02:14:09,763
It's a complete mess.

1565
02:14:09,848 --> 02:14:11,268
I am Groot.

1566
02:14:11,433 --> 02:14:13,353
I am not boring. You're boring.

1567
02:14:13,519 --> 02:14:14,519
You know what's boring?

1568
02:14:14,603 --> 02:14:17,683
Sitting there,
playing that mind-numbing game.

1569
02:14:17,856 --> 02:14:21,566
What's boring is me tripping
over your vines every day!

1570
02:14:22,027 --> 02:14:23,197
I'm not boring!

1571
02:14:23,362 --> 02:14:24,442
I am Groot.

1572
02:14:26,114 --> 02:14:28,614
And now I know how Yondu felt.

1573
02:15:04,403 --> 02:15:06,613
In these times of hardship...

1574
02:15:07,739 --> 02:15:09,829
just remember...

1575
02:15:10,409 --> 02:15:14,459
We. Are. Groot.

1576
02:15:17,749 --> 02:15:18,919
Hey, fellas.

1577
02:15:19,084 --> 02:15:20,754
Wait, where are you going?

1578
02:15:20,919 --> 02:15:23,339
You were supposed to be my lift home.

1579
02:15:23,505 --> 02:15:25,135
How will I get out of here?

1580
02:15:25,299 --> 02:15:26,509
Hey! Aw, gee...

1581
02:15:26,675 --> 02:15:29,425
I've got so many
more stories to tell.

1582
02:15:29,595 --> 02:15:30,845
Aw, guys.

1583
02:15:31,013 --> 02:15:33,343
Oh, gee...

1584
